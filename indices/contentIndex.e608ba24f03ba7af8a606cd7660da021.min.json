You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be be found under `data/config.yaml`. An annotated example configuration is shown below.\n\n```yaml\nname: Your name here! # Shows in the footer\nenableToc: true # Whether to show a Table of Contents\nenableLinkPreview: true # whether to render card previews for links\ndescription: Page description to show to search engines\npage_title: Quartz Example Page # Default Page Title\n\nlinks: # Links to show in footer\n  - link_name: Twitter\n    link: https://twitter.com/_jzhao\n  - link_name: Github\n    link: https://github.com/jackyzha0\n```\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml\nenableLegend: false # automatically generate a legend\nenableDrag: true # allow dragging nodes in the graph\nenableZoom: true # allow zooming and panning the graph\ndepth: -1 # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\npaths: # colour specific nodes path off of their path\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what actually gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

It comes with a really nice editor and graphical interface to preview all of your local files.\n\nThis step is **highly recommended**.\n\n🔗 [How to setup your Obsidian Vault to work with Quartz](notes/obsidian.md)\n\n### Ignoring Files\nOnly want to publish a subset of all of your notes? Don't worry, Quartz makes this a simple two-step process.\n\n❌ [Excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md)\n\n### Folder Structure\nHere's a rough overview of what's what.\n\n**All content in your garden can found in the `/content` folder.** To make edits, you can open any of the files and make changes directly and save it. You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.*\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\nenableToc: false # do not show a table of contents on this page\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n## Previewing Changes\nThis step is purely optional and mostly for those who want to see the published version of their digital garden locally before opening it up to the internet. This is *highly recommended* but not required.\n\n👀 [Preview Quartz Changes](notes/preview%20changes.md)\n\nFor those who like to live life more on the edge, viewing the garden through Obsidian gets you pretty close to the real thing.\n\n## Publishing Changes\nNow that you know the basics of managing your digital garden using Quartz, you can publish it to the internet!\n\n🌍 [Hosting Quartz online!](notes/hosting.md)\n\nHaving problems?

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`.\n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`.\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect!

But the player isn't a node, themselves. They're a vector, or they can be. The player drifts through the space between characters, choosing to comply with them or not.\n\nIf they player does not, we don't see them necessarily try to exercise power over the player. This would be interesting to see. If an NPC were ignored, what could they do?\n\nCould this be a whole game? You simply wander and pass messages - or don't - and whether you do or don't affects the world around you? The idea of a repeater makes sense, here.\n\nThe people who are in your mech voice different ideas about the messages you move. None of them question whether or not the player-as-mech moves the messages, but they do notice when some messages take forever to get to their destinations. Some even talk about messages from times before, even millions of years prior, that were never delivered, but remain in the system.\n\nThe messages could be proc gen from tables for generating this universe, and what characters say could follow out of that.\n\nthe distance between cities is often like the distance between planets, but communications networks that are facilitated by mechs are all that keep humanity connected. Is this [[Death Stranding]] now? The repeaters move between relays which connect to cables. The people inside of the mech are what keep it under control; this is not what they were designed for. The player, and the mech, are essentially a farm animal. They're a horse for the people inside of it.\n\nWhen the mech moves from one major location to another, the people on board often are decades of years older, or have all entirely died and have been replaced\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-14T22:41:44.978305629Z","tags":null},"/private/2022/2022-05-14":{"title":"","content":"# 2022-05-14\n## #todo \n- [x] Take morning meds\n- [x] Take evening meds\n\n## #journal \nFold time in storytelling.

It contains a dictionary of animations (referenced by name) and custom blend times between their transitions. Additionally, animations can be played and blended in different [[channels]].\n- AnimationPlayer is more suited than Tween for animations where you know the final values in advance.

Musicians and composers often use the circle of fifths to describe the musical relationships between pitches. Its design is helpful in composing and harmonizing melodies, building chords, and modulating to different keys within a composition.[1]\n- Using the system of just intonation, a perfect fifth consists of two pitches with a frequency ratio of 3:2, but generating a twelve perfect fifths in this way does not result in a return to the pitch class of the starting note. To adjust for this, instruments are generally tuned with the equal temperament system. Twelve equal-temperament fifths lead to a note exactly seven octaves above the initial tone—this results in a perfect fifth that is equivalent to seven equal-temperament semitones.\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-14T22:41:44.98230565Z","tags":null},"/private/Readwise/Articles/Copyleft-Compliance-Projects":{"title":"","content":"# Copyleft Compliance Projects\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article2.74d541386bbf.png)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Copyleft Compliance]]\n- Full Title: Copyleft Compliance Projects\n- Category: #articles\n- URL: https://sfconservancy.org/copyleft-compliance/vizio.html\n\n## Highlights\n- IRVINE, Calif. (Oct. 19, 2021) Software Freedom Conservancy announced today it has filed a lawsuit against Vizio Inc. for what it calls repeated failures to fulfill even the basic requirements of the General Public License (GPL).\n  The lawsuit alleges that Vizio’s TV products, built on its SmartCast system, contain software that Vizio unfairly appropriated from a community of developers who intended consumers to have very specific rights to modify, improve, share, and reinstall modified versions of the software.\n  The GPL is a copyleft license that ensures end users the freedom to run, study, share, and modify the software. Copyleft is a kind of software licensing that leverages the restrictions of copyright, but with the intent to promote sharing (using copyright licensing to freely use and repair software).\n- According to the lawsuit, a consumer of a product such as this has the right to access the source code so that it can be modified, studied, and redistributed (under the appropriate license conditions).\n  “We are asking the court to require Vizio to make good on its obligations under copyleft compliance requirements,” says Sandler. She explains that in past litigation, the plaintiffs have always been copyright holders of the specific GPL code. In this case, Software Freedom Conservancy hopes to demonstrate that it's not just the copyright holders, but also the receivers of the licensed code who are entitled to rights.\n  The lawsuit suit seeks no monetary damages, but instead seeks access to the technical information that the copyleft licenses require Vizio to provide to all customers who purchase its TVs (specifically, the plaintiff is asking for the technical information via “specific performance” rather than “damages”).\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-14T22:41:44.98230565Z","tags":null},"/private/Readwise/Articles/Dear-Future":{"title":"","content":"# Dear Future\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/default-book-icon-4.11327a2af05a.png)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: \n- Full Title: Dear Future\n- Category: #articles\n\n## Highlights\n- Dear Future is a multiplayer wandering #game where you photograph a cryptic city using an inherited camera.

According to him, not a single refuser in Russia has been prosecuted so far: only flight from the battlefield or collaboration with the enemy is considered \"desertion\". Refusal to re-participate in the \"special operation\" is a failure to comply with the order, the negative consequences of which still need to be proved for impution of the article of the Criminal Code to the [[objector]]. Several examples of such boycott leaked in some media - from the refusal of going to Ukraine by airborne paratroopers in Pskov (about 60 people in only one unit!) to homecoming by about 300 local and Russian combatants from the 4th military base in South Ossetia after the death of some fighter on a minefield and the commander’s prohibition to evacuate his body for burial.

They work well for spawn locations, pickups, and instancing Godot scenes.\n  Solid classes are pieces of geometry with special properties, like doors and breakable walls. You can use these entities to tie scripts and other functionality to brushes in the world. Collision and meshes are optional as well.\n  Base classes are empty; they only contain properties as a template for other classes. They’re handy when needed, but never required.\n  Keep in mind that “Entities” and “Classes” mean the same thing for this entire page. Qodot calls them classes, Trenchbroom calls them entities. Neither of these systems inherently interact with the classes found in GDscript or C#, they are completely separate.\n- Creating an FGD file\n  This should be your first step before adding any entities for a brand new Godot project.\n  FGD fles (Forge Game Data) hold definitions for entities. They are required to make Trenchbroom and QodotMap understand custom entities.\n  While you can piggyback off of Qodot.fgd included in all installations of Qodot, this puts your custom entities at risk if you choose to update Qodot, since Qodot.fgd will be overwritten with the defaults.\n  It is safer to create a unique FGD file for your game that goes with the custom Trenchbroom game config created earlier in the Applying Textures guide.\n  Right-click on the Filesystem dock and click Create New Resource. Make a QodotFGDFile:\n  I recommend saving this file as your_game_name_fgd.tres so it’s easy to search for “fgd” or just your game’s name the Filesystem dock. Mine is practice_fgd.tres.\n  Change the Fgd Name to your game’s name.\n  Note\n  You have to set the Fgd Name so it doesn’t conflict with the “Qodot” namespace, otherwise Trenchbroom will discard your FGD.\n  FGDs by default contain example entity definitions, which we don’t need as Qodot.fgd contains all of these already. It helps to start an FGD with a completely clean entity definitions array, so you can focus on adding new entities not covered by Qodot.fgd.\n- Adding an Entity Definition to an FGD\n  With your FGD open, click on the Entity Definitions array to open it. Drop your new entity definition into any empty slot in the list.\n  We still need to update the Trenchbroom game config to include our new entity definitions. Later we’ll make sure the QodotMap node catches wind of the new entity definitions.\n- Adding required Entity Definitions to your FGD\n  Before trying to consider your FGD complete, you may want to include worldspawn layer and group functionality in your FGD. These are kept as classes in Qodot.fgd, and are recommended to copy-over into all custom FGDs.\n  These entities are:\n  worldspawn_solid\n  worldspawn_base\n  group_solid\n  You can expect them to work out of the box and not require changing, so they can be left in the /addons/qodot folder and updated as needed.\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-14T22:41:44.98230565Z","tags":null},"/private/Readwise/Articles/Equal-temperament":{"title":"","content":"# Equal temperament\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article1.be68295a7e40.png)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[prime limits]]\n- Full Title: Equal temperament\n- Category: #articles\n- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament\n\n## Highlights\n- An equal temperament is a musical temperament or tuning system, which approximates just intervals by dividing an octave (or other interval) into equal steps.\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-14T22:41:44.98230565Z","tags":null},"/private/Readwise/Articles/Finite-State-Machine-in-Godot-GDQuest":{"title":"","content":"# Finite State Machine in Godot · GDQuest\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article0.00998d930354.png)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Nathan Lovato]]\n- Full Title: Finite State Machine in Godot · GDQuest\n- Category: #articles\n- URL: https://www.gdquest.com/tutorial/godot/design-patterns/finite-state-machine/\n\n## Highlights\n- Split an object’s finite number of states or behaviors into individual state objects and only allow one of them to control their host at a time.\n  You’ve probably heard of this pattern called State, or Finite State Machines, often represented as a graph.\n    - Tags: [[favorite]] \n\n\n# Finite State Machine in Godot · GDQuest\n##### [[2022-05-10]] \u003e Finite State Machine in Godot · GDQuest | 05-10-2022\n\n- Godot Strategy\n\t- Use [[nodes]] to create states/rooms/dungeons for the game to move through.

It's like nested prefabs: you can create a BlinkingLight scene and a BrokenLantern scene that uses the BlinkingLight. Then, create a city filled with BrokenLanterns. Change the BlinkingLight's color, save, and all the BrokenLanterns in the city will update instantly.\n- Also note that Godot offers many different types of objects called [[nodes]], each with a specific purpose. Nodes are part of a tree and always inherit from their parents up to the Node [[class]]. Although the engine does feature some nodes like collision shapes that a parent physics body will use, most nodes work independently from one another. In other words, Godot's nodes do not work like components in some other game engines.\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-14T22:41:44.98230565Z","tags":null},"/private/Readwise/Articles/Godots-design-philosophy-2":{"title":"","content":"# Godot's design philosophy ¶\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article0.00998d930354.png)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Godot Docs]]\n- Full Title: Godot's design philosophy ¶\n- Category: #articles\n- URL: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/introduction/godot_design_philosophy.html\n\n## Highlights\n- Godot offers dedicated 2D and 3D rendering engines.

It controls how things happen and how things react around the [[player]]’s actions. There is a limit to this, however, and this is labelled as offline and online A-Life as a way to save from performance issues.\n- Actions carried out by the [[player]] cause ripples through the actions of the AI, updating as the [[player]] traverses the world. The idea behind the simulation is to make it seem like AI between loading zones are moving and active. It works extremely well even though to some degree it is just smoke and mirrors from GSC Game World — a convincing simulation of how a human would react if put into the shoes of an NPC.\n- A-Life has a natural function of branching to it. AI within Stalker has a set of rules it must follow based on NPC type and what their role is in relation to the [[player]]. Based on this, the AI will react in various ways. Due to how A-Life works, a cascading set of reactions can take place based on game events and what the [[player]] does.\n  For example, if a bandit enemy is set on a random patrol in a group and is ambushed by the [[player]] yet doesn’t die, this Bandit has the possibility of joining another group or continuing on his original path.\n  In addition to this example, if the [[player]] comes across the bandit wounded and is then healed by the [[player]], the previous rules change due to the relation to the [[player]] from an act of kindness.\n- Compared to other AI, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. simulates human-like decision making. Instead of waiting for the [[player]] to enter the vicinity, the AI is proactive and based on certain rules will make decisions on their own.\n- Online A-Life Status can be linked to all AI within a certain radius from the [[player]]’s location. Everything outside of this radius is considered Offline. The radius around the [[player]] in the vanilla, unmodded game is roughly 150 meters. This radius can vary — it has varied in the later games in the series but also has been changed via community modding. The A-Life system is working in the background and taking note of everything that happens in the Online so that it can make changes within the Offline AI.\n- A-Life takes all the Online information that it has and makes changes to everything offline whilst the game time passes. The reason for this is that as the [[player]] progresses through the game, enemies \u0026 monsters move around in other places, meaning events can also occur away from the [[player]].\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-14T22:41:44.98230565Z","tags":null},"/private/Readwise/Articles/Highlights-From-stockmusicmusician.com":{"title":"","content":"# Highlights From stockmusicmusician.com\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article2.74d541386bbf.png)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[stockmusicmusician.com]]\n- Full Title: Highlights From stockmusicmusician.com\n- Category: #articles\n- URL: https://www.stockmusicmusician.com/blog/types-of-reverb\n\n## Highlights\n- Plate reverb is incredibly unique, as it came from a large, physical metal sheet hanging inside of a box. Plate reverbs, unlike rooms, aren’t made to mimic the acoustic of the real world. In fact, the plate reverb was the very first artificial reverb out there.\n- There is nothing quite like the sound of a spring reverb. This is a type of reverb that isn’t made to emulate a space, but rather a mechanical device. Similar to a plate reverb, a spring reverb makes use of transducers, which produce the initial sound and drive it through the device. In this case, that device is a spring.\n- Room reverb is the most basic type of reverb. Think of the room you’re in right now. It’s a space with walls, right? Of course, the room you’re in is probably very different than the room I am in writing this right now in terms of shape and size, even though we categorize them in the same way.\n- As opposed to rooms, which are designed for living, sleeping, and entertaining without the preciousness of sound in mind, halls are designed with the goal of taking sound and expanding sounds into something long, lush, and majestic.\n- Chambers are a wonderful middle ground between rooms and halls. Before the time of digital recording units lived a humble audio engineer with a small studio who dreamed of putting his or her music in a large, reverberant space.\n- Ambience is quite unique, as it has a very short decay time, typically 0.5 seconds or lower. Ambience reverbs often use early reflections, creating a very faithful recreation of the emulated space. The main goal with an ambience reverb is to create an effect that is as dry as possible while adding a slight bit of space and color to the sound.\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-14T22:41:44.98230565Z","tags":null},"/private/Readwise/Articles/ITCareerQuestions":{"title":"","content":"# ITCareerQuestions\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article3.5c705a01b476.png)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Storage engineers]]\n- Full Title: ITCareerQuestions\n- Category: #articles\n- URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/wiki/index\n\n## Highlights\n- Answers to other questions that get asked all the time:\n  No, you're not too old\n  IT is a profession where you will have to deal with people.

Then we changed the way quests were generated. Characters would now get quests not from dealers, but from the so-called smart terrains. A character’s life now worked in such a way, that he took the quest generated by some smart terrain, then walked to the destination it had set for him. After getting there, he would get points, and the smart terrain would take him under control for some time. Under the control of a smart terrain, the character prioritized and carried out the available tasks. This is how the game got faction bases, stalkers by campfires, and such. That is, migration of characters from place to place, their movement between levels, all was caused by changing goals.\n- In retrospect, what parts of the system and/or development process were you particularly happy with? DI: I was very happy with the work done when I followed a stalker from one level to another, saw how he searched for artifacts, found them, returned to the dealer, approached him, traded, picked a new quest, went on — too bad this did not make it into the original game. It was very interesting to witness. When we were implementing goal-oriented action planning, it was very interesting to watch two hostile unarmed characters that knew were to get weapons and ammo: they first run to the weapons, find that they have no ammo, then run to the ammo, the first one to get there causes the other to panic if he is still far away from weapons and ammo, the panicking character gets wounded and falls, the other approaches to finish him (this did not make it into the original game, since all characters received unlimited ammo, and such situations could not take place). It was very interesting to watch a fight of several dogs and one stalker — it was breathtaking to see this sight, as he flees the dogs, switching covers. Sometimes he died quickly, sometimes managed to take down 4-5 dogs, and sometimes all 6.\n- Do not reinvent the wheel. Use the internet to find solutions to your problems.\n- Have a clear idea of the game you are making, of which features it will have and which it will not, use prototyping to avoid implementing features that do not make it into the release.\n- Debug characters with comfortable tools: each component should have its debug draw/mode/screen. Draw paths (all the iterations, all the smooth stages and so on), draw visibility checks to find out why character doesn’t see, draw covers information and so on. To debug characters' behavior we created their debug screen with all the data from all the layers, so we can easily pick the character and find out what is wrong with him. Pause and time factor are invaluable for the animation/movement/orientation debug.\n- Let programmers do programmer work and designers design. Designer is a bad programmer, programmer is a bad designer. This could become a problem when using scripts. Let people do things in which they are strong. Instead of advancing designers in programming, create WYSIWYP editor with many options to tune.\n- Be aware of all the new developments in your area, read Internet resources, like AIGameDev.com.\n- Implement something new in your game. Maybe it is only one thing (since several can be too much for a single project), but necessarily new. We see an excellent implementation of decision trees in Black \u0026 White, Jeff Orkin has created an exceptional implementation of a goal-oriented action planner in F.E.A.R., we have tried to make a kind of approximated A-Life in a shooter, maybe someone will make something new tomorrow — this will benefit the players, who will get diverse games, and developers themselves, who will set an example of a good method or approach.\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-14T22:41:44.98230565Z","tags":null},"/private/Readwise/Articles/Introduction-to-shaders":{"title":"","content":"# Introduction to shaders ¶\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article3.5c705a01b476.png)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Godot Docs]]\n- Full Title: Introduction to shaders ¶\n- Category: #articles\n- Document Tags: [[Godot]] \n- URL: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/shaders/introduction_to_shaders.html\n\n## Highlights\n- Because of their parallel nature, though, shaders don't process information the way a typical program does. Shader code runs on each vertex or pixel in isolation. You cannot store data between frames either. As a result, when working with shaders, you need to code and think differently from other programming languages.\n- Instead of supplying a general-purpose configuration for all uses (2D, 3D, particles), you must specify the type of shader you're writing. Different types support different render modes, built-in variables, and processing functions.\n  In Godot, all shaders need to specify their type in the first line, like so:\n  shader_type spatial;\n  Here are the available types:\n  spatial for 3D rendering.\n  canvas_item for 2D rendering.\n  particles for particle systems.\n- Depending on the shader type, you can override different processor functions. For spatial and canvas_item, you have access to vertex(), fragment(), and light(). For particles, you only have access to vertex().\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-14T22:41:44.98230565Z","tags":null},"/private/Readwise/Articles/Introduction-to-the-animation-features":{"title":"","content":"# Introduction to the animation features ¶\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article3.5c705a01b476.png)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Godot Docs]]\n- Full Title: Introduction to the animation features ¶\n- Category: #articles\n- URL: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/animation/introduction.html#create-an-animationplayer-node\n\n## Highlights\n- [[AnimationPlayer can drive systems]]\n- The animation panel\n  The animation panel¶\n  Animation controls (i.e. add, load, save, and delete animations)\n  The tracks listing\n  The timeline with keyframes\n  The timeline and track controls, where you can zoom the timeline and edit tracks for example.\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-14T22:41:44.98230565Z","tags":null},"/private/Readwise/Articles/John-Glas":{"title":"","content":"# John Glas\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article2.74d541386bbf.png)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[David Bryce]]\n- Full Title: John Glas\n- Category: #articles\n- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Glas\n\n## Highlights\n- As Glas found inconsistencies with the Church of Scotland and what he found in the New Testament, he led a church movement during the first half of the 18th century which promoted the ideal that the church should be governed by the simple order in the New Testament rather than by human councils and synods.\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-14T22:41:44.98230565Z","tags":null},"/private/Readwise/Articles/Just-intonation":{"title":"","content":"# Just intonation\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article4.6bc1851654a0.png)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[harmonic series]]\n- Full Title: Just intonation\n- Category: #articles\n- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_intonation\n\n## Highlights\n- In music, just intonation or pure intonation is the attempt to tune all musical intervals as whole number ratios (such as 3:2 or 4:3) of frequencies.

In 3D modelling software, CSG is mostly known as \"Boolean Operators\".\n  Level prototyping is one of the main uses of CSG in Godot. This technique allows users to create simple versions of most common shapes by combining primitives. Interior environments can be created by using inverted primitives.\n- The CSG [[nodes]] in Godot are mainly intended for prototyping. There is no built-in support for UV mapping or editing 3D polygons (though extruded 2D polygons can be used with the CSGPolygon node).\n- To apply triplanar mapping to a CSG node, select it, go to the Inspector, click the [empty] text next to Material Override (or Material for individual CSG [[nodes]]). Choose New SpatialMaterial. Click the newly created material's icon to edit it. Unfold the Albedo section and load a texture into the Texture property. Now, unfold the Uv1 section and check Triplanar. You can change the texture offset and scale on each axis by playing with the Scale and Offset properties just above. Higher values in the Scale property will cause the texture to repeat more often.\n- You can copy a SpatialMaterial to reuse it across CSG [[nodes]]. To do so, click the dropdown arrow next to a material property in the Inspector and choose Copy. To paste it, select the node you'd like to apply the material onto, click the dropdown arrow next to its material property then choose Paste.\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-14T22:41:44.98230565Z","tags":null},"/private/Readwise/Articles/Psychoacoustics":{"title":"","content":"# Psychoacoustics\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article4.6bc1851654a0.png)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Bell Labs]]\n- Full Title: Psychoacoustics\n- Category: #articles\n- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoacoustics\n\n## Highlights\n- Psychoacoustics is the branch of psychophysics involving the scientific study of sound perception and audiology—how humans perceive various sounds.

Leftist professor George Ciccariello-Maher found himself the target of both online and mainstream media attacks when a tweet he made welcoming “White Genocide” was picked up and circulated, leading to a coordinated campaign of complaints being sent to Drexel university where he works. Leaving aside any judgement on the effectiveness of the satire, what we do learn from this case is that some liberals took the “white genocide” trope seriously, as a form of hate speech, rather than recognise the perversity of its construction, which amongst other things imagines the coming death of the “white race” at the hands of multiracial relationships and mass immigration.\n- In September 2000, Anthony Browne penned a sobre report for the Observer newspaper entitled “The Last Days of a White World”. Browne, latterly an advisor to Boris Johnson during his time as London mayor and now head of the British Bankers Association, informed readers that “40,000-year-old indigenous white populations” of Europe were soon to become minorities in their own lands. The report is written with the objective restraint of a journalist who has held senior political and economic briefs at the BBC, The Times, The Daily Mail and The Spectator. Browne quotes liberally from Far Right nationalists, sitting politicians in the US and Germany, and black and Asian British journalists and commentators, each with different takes on the demographic changes brought about by South to North migration and divergent birth rates.\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-14T22:41:44.98230565Z","tags":null},"/private/Readwise/Articles/Thirty-Years-War":{"title":"","content":"# Thirty Years' War\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article1.be68295a7e40.png)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Jacques Callot]]\n- Full Title: Thirty Years' War\n- Category: #articles\n- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Years%27_War\n\n## Highlights\n- The Thirty Years' War[l] took place largely within the Holy Roman Empire from 1618 to 1648.

Therefore, applying rotations in X, Y, and Z is not enough: you also need a rotation order.\n- The result of all this is that you should not use the rotation property of Spatial [[nodes]] in Godot for games. It's there to be used mainly in the editor, for coherence with the 2D engine, and for simple rotations (generally just one axis, or even two in limited cases). As much as you may be tempted, don't use it.\n- Godot uses the Transform datatype for orientations. Each Spatial node contains a transform property which is relative to the parent's transform, if the parent is a Spatial-derived type.\n  It is also possible to access the world coordinate transform via the global_transform property.\n- A transform has a Basis (transform.basis sub-property), which consists of three Vector3 vectors. These are accessed via the transform.basis property and can be accessed directly by transform.basis.x, transform.basis.y, and transform.basis.z. Each vector points in the direction its axis has been rotated, so they effectively describe the node's total rotation. The scale (as long as it's uniform) can also be inferred from the length of the axes. A basis can also be interpreted as a 3x3 matrix and used as transform.basis[x][y].\n- It is recommended you not scale [[nodes]] that are going to be manipulated; scale their children [[nodes]] instead (such as MeshInstance). If you absolutely must scale the node, then re-apply it at the end:\n- You might be thinking at this point: \"Ok, but how do I get angles from a transform?\". The answer again is: you don't. You must do your best to stop thinking in angles.\n  Imagine you need to shoot a bullet in the direction your [[player]] is facing. Just use the forward axis (commonly Z or -Z).\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-14T22:41:44.98230565Z","tags":null},"/private/Readwise/Articles/Using-VisualShaders":{"title":"","content":"# Using VisualShaders ¶\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article0.00998d930354.png)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Godot Docs]]\n- Full Title: Using VisualShaders ¶\n- Category: #articles\n- URL: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/shaders/visual_shaders.html#doc-visual-shaders\n\n## Highlights\n- Just as VisualScript is an alternative for users that prefer a graphical approach to coding, VisualShaders are the visual alternative for creating shaders.\n- As shaders are inherently linked to visuals, the graph-based approach with previews of textures, materials, etc. offers a lot of additional convenience compared to purely script-based shaders.

Internships are the exception - always, always, always do an internship before you graduate. Always.\n  Certifications - great to have with or without a degree. In addition to a degree, they'll make you stand out more. If you don't have a degree, certs are the best way to show that you have tech knowledge.\n  Attitude - this is an often overlooked but critical aspect of the interview process.

The undermining of wages and the use of unskilled labour clashed with the existing ‘social contract’ between workers and masters that prescribed ‘customary’ wages that had been maintained by tradition over many decades.\n- In Yorkshire, the Luddites were led by the croppers, highly skilled finishers of woolen cloth who commanded much higher wages that other workers, and were highly organised. For the past decade they had petitioned Parliament to enforce obsolescent legislation enforcing apprenticeship, and against ‘gig mills’, machines invented in the 16th century which could do part of the croppers’ job. But the greatest threat to them was a more recent invention, the hated shearing frame which eventually almost entirely displaced them over the next ten years. In 1809, under pressure from the manufacturers, Parliament repealed all the old legislation, thus removing the artisans’ last hope of redress for their grievances by legal and democratic means.\n- In addition to the economic and technological changes which produced Luddism, the period after 1789 was one in which the communities of the emerging working-class were radicalised by the Revolution in France and the writings of Tom Paine, etc. The strongholds of radicalism were Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and Lancashire where pro-Jacobin groups operated in secret. After the passage of the Combination Acts of 1799 which banned all trade union organisation, these too were forced underground, and the Luddite groups grew naturally from these two roots.\n- The Luddite uprising began in Nottingham in November 1811, and spread to Yorkshire and Lancashire in early 1812. The Luddites’ main tactic was to warn the masters to remove the frames from their premises. If the masters refused, the Luddites smashed the machines in nocturnal raids, using massive sledgehammers.\n- It is widely agreed that the Luddites’ leader, in whose name their letters and proclamations were issued, known as ‘General Ludd’ or ‘King Ludd’, did not actually exist. The name is said to derive from one Ned Ludd, an apprentice weaver, who some years earlier smashed a loom in a rage at his master who had beaten him.\n- Machine breaking had occurred sporadically in disputes between workers and owners many times before, but the Luddites were much more systematic and organised. In Nottinghamshire, the Luddites played on the Robin Hood myth: as one of their songs had it,\n- ‘Chant no more your old rhymes about bold Robin Hood,\n  His feats I but little admire,\n  I will sing the Achievements of General Ludd\n  Now the Hero of Nottinghamshire’\n- The Luddites were a secret society which administered oaths of silence to ‘twist in’ new members. These were extremely effective in preventing capture: for a year, despite flooding the Midlands and North of England with spies, and more troops than were currently fighting Napoleon in Spain, the authorities made only a few arrests of minor players. Spies were generally unsuccessful because all the members of Ludd’s army were well known to each other as fellow stockingers and croppers. Their success in evading capture, bemoaned in many reports to the Home Office, was due to the extremely strong support of the their communities, who were suffering with them and had been united against the manufacturers. Lord Byron, a Nottinghamshire landowner, mocked the efforts of the troops:\n- In Manchester, a warehouse of a manufacturer who used power looms was burned down in early February 1812. In general, the Lancashire Luddite attacks focused on the large mills and some took place in the daytime as part of large-scale food riots involving hundreds of people and sometimes involving direct confrontation with soldiers. Several large mills in the Manchester and Stockport districts were burnt down and as many as 50 people, including women, may have been killed in the these incidents, which continued from February to May 1812.\n- After the crushing of their revolt, the factory system, with all its horrors could no longer be resisted and generations of working class men and women and children were forced to work 12 hours or more per day for a pittance, their lives running according to the rhythm of the machines, their deaths often caused by them.\n- Above all, the destruction of the Luddites by the State established the principle that industrialists have the right to continually impose new technology, without any process of negotiation, either with the people who have to operate it or with society at large. It is this principle and the resistance to it that have led in our time to backlashes against the corporate imposition of technologies like genetic engineering, nuclear power and now ‘geoengineering’.1\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-14T22:41:44.98230565Z","tags":null},"/private/Readwise/Articles/Wikipedia":{"title":"","content":"# Wikipedia\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article1.be68295a7e40.png)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Pythagorean comma]]\n- Full Title: Wikipedia\n- Category: #articles\n- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone\n\n## Highlights\n- [[semitone]]\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-14T22:41:44.98230565Z","tags":null},"/private/Readwise/Articles/You-Cannot-Kill-Me-In-A-Way-That-Matters":{"title":"","content":"# You Cannot Kill Me In A Way That Matters\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article1.be68295a7e40.png)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[GuAgIsOrAb]]\n- Full Title: You Cannot Kill Me In A Way That Matters\n- Category: #articles\n- URL: https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-cannot-kill-me-in-a-way-that-matters\n\n## Highlights\n- Around June 15th, 2018, Tumblr user personsonable posted a three-paragraph story about a person asking a mushroom for the name of God under gunpoint, to which the mushroom replies by taunting its supremacy, terrifying and enraging the person.\n  personsonable me holding a gun to a mushroom: tell me the name of god you fungal piece of shit mushroom: can you feel your heart burning? can you feel the struggle within? the fear within me is beyond anything your soul can make. you cannot kill me in a way that matters me cocking the gun, tears streaming down my face: I'M NOT FUCKING SCARED OF YOU miaislying Hey OP?

[[Immersive sims are often defined by indirect actions]].\n## New highlights added May 17, 2022 at 7:18 AM\n- Sometimes the goals are quantifiable, and therefore strong, while in other cases, they are experiential and loose. Without a goal, players won't know to what end they are following the rules. Soccer is an example of a quantifiable, and therefore strong, goal-one that guides and gives purpose to the play experience. On the other end of the spectrum is Jane Friedhoff's Slam City Oracles (see Figure 2.7). Players take on the role of one of two young girls in a world filled with snack food, fantastic buildings, pinwheels, and other quirky objects. The goal? Bounce around the environment with a friend, and in the process knock things around-riot grrrls in a perfectly playful world. The player can bounce higher and higher or just stick around one area and slam to their heart's content. While there is a score, it is intentionally complex with absurdly high numbers that provide humor more than a measure of player performance. For a player of Slam City Oracles, the outcome isn't the focus; it's the process of getting there and the different things that happen along the way.\n- Goals are a really useful tool for game designers. They are one of the only ways we can guide players' experiences in engaging with the actions, objects, and playspaces we design. A game's goal frames the play experience, suggesting to players how they might engage the game. The goals shape the space of possibility for players. A game's goals also shape how players perceive the available actions and objects within the playspace. Do they approach them as a means to an end or simply as an experience unto themselves?\n- Challenge One of the things that designers use to craft a player's experience of trying to reach their goal is challenge. All games provide some level of challenge, even if the players provide it themselves.\n  Challenge is often described in relation to the psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's idea of the flow state.? For Csikszentmihalyi, flow is described as a state of high focus and enjoyment.\n  Perhaps most famous is his chart of the flow state, showing the \"flow channel\" between anxiety and boredom, rising with skill and challenge (see Figure 2.10).\n- Many game designers use the concept of flow state to describe an ideal difficulty for level design, increasing the challenge to fit evolving player skill by just the right amount to avoid ien increasing the challenge to fit evolving player skill by just the right amount to avoid cniking into the anxiety zone or plummeting toward boredom.\n  Certainly, flow can be a useful concept for game designers, but here's a word of caution about she idea of flow. It can be tempting to correlate a state of flow with good game design, but just as many movies might provide us with an escape from ordinary life or a happy ending, not all movies need to be that way. Sometimes great films are made about ordinary life; or their endings aren't happy. For games, flow is a response to challenge meeting the player's skill level, and it creates a kind of play that can be highly satisfying. But equally satisfying are games that don't challenge players' skill. Instead, the game might confront the player with a challenging narrative or an experience that the player can enjoy regardless of skill. So, flow can be experienced in games, but it's not the only kind of experience players can have in games, and it's not better\n- Decision-Making and Feedback There are two related game design tools to consider when thinking about how players understand a game's state: the decision-making and feedback that propel a player through their play experience. Let's use bicycles as an example here. For a bike to go forward, the rider bas to pedal it. But while doing the pedaling, the rider is making hundreds of decisions every second-how fast should they go? Which direction should they head? Are there cars, pedestrians, or other cyclists to keep an eye on? While operating a bicycle, the rider has to make lots of decisions.\n  Games also require that players constantly evaluate what is happening while continuing to carry out their actions in the game. This is what Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman refer to as the \"action-outcome unit.\"5 All play experiences are made of a sequence of actions-pedal the bike-that have outcomes-the bike moves forward-that lead to the next action-turn the handle bars-that lead to the next outcome-the bike turns left. Ultimately, this is what gameplay is made up of: dozens, even hundreds or thousands, of small decisions that each creates a change in the game's state. From these, play experiences emerge, shaped along the way by the goals and subgoals, however loose or strong they might be.\n- [[abstraction]]\n- Theme The next basic game design tool is theme. A game's theme is the logical framework for how the game represents itself. Designers use it to shape the player experience and help them understand the game more quickly and intuitively.\n  Take chess as an example again. Chess doesn't have a story, at least not an implicit one. In fact, when we talk about chess, many people call it an abstract strategy game. (The abstract in abstract strategy game refers to the game not having representational qualities, similar to Go.)\n- [[Kentucky Route Zero]] by Cardboard Computer (see Figure 2.24) represents yet another use of theme in games. It has a very strong theme in terms of its mood, its art style, and its interaction model. The player is an observer on a storyworld centering on a truck driver named Conway who travels along the eponymous [[Kentucky Route Zero]]. The game draws on old graphic text adventures and point-and-click adventure games combined with a clean, minimal illustration style and cinematic animations. While the interactivity and the story of [[Kentucky Route Zero]] are not as tightly coupled to theme as they are in Way, they do work well together to create an atmospheric play experience. Everything about the sensory elements of the game supports the moody, magical story inside the game. [[Kentucky Route Zero]] explores an aesthetic theme that envelopes the player in a space of possibility more focused on atmosphere and narrative.\n- Storytelling This brings us to the next game design tool: storytelling. Often, a game's theme is embedded in its story, as happens with film, comics, literature, and more. Many games are constructed around storyworlds within which players inhabit characters and carry out actions via their avatars. Decisions made by the characters lead to the unfolding of the story. Of course, we can tell stories through sports-recounting the tale of the winning goal just seconds before the match ends-or in boardgames-recounting the story of how the players came to almost, but not quite, eliminate the four viruses in Pandemic. But in many videogames, the story is a larger part of the experience. The layered impact of our actions and the advancing of the story often go hand-in-hand. The less directly we control our role in a game, the more story cues help us make sense of what happens and how well we are advancing the story.\n  In the game Braid (see Figure 2.25), players control the main character, Tim, who has lost his princess. To help Tim find her, the player navigates Tim through a puzzle platformer game.\n- Context of Play The last basic tool of game design is the context within which a game is played. Taking into account where the game is played and by whom has a real impact on the experience. Will players be playing on their phone or tablet? In a public space? Alone or with friends and family? Of course, game designers can't always predict this, but taking it into account can make a big difference for the player. Imagine trying to play a mobile phone game that has hour-long play sessions, and you will soon see why most mobile games have shorter sessions developed around the concept of playing during a commute, in between meetings, or at a coffee shop waiting for a friend to arrive.\n  Speaking of mobile games, take the iPhone app, Tiny Games, by Hide and Seek (see Figure 2.28).\n  Tiny Games includes just that: a slew of tiny physical games meant to be played in short sessions in a variety of contexts. The first thing the player sees when opening the app is a question: “Where are you?\" The player can select Home, Walk, Road, Bar, In Line, or Work. Selecting \"Home\" and \"two players\" might get you the game \"Knife Fork Spoon,\" based on the folkgame Rock, Paper, Seissors, to be played while waiting for a piece of bread to pop out of the toaster. Each round, the mer keeps the utensil the other plaver played. By the end of the game (when the toast is done), players have the utensils remaining for their meal, This game is designed to be played with a mend in a kitchen, and as with all of the Tiny Games, is meant for a specific context.\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-14T22:41:44.98230565Z","tags":null},"/private/Readwise/Books/Polystate":{"title":"","content":"# Polystate\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61UBiPZ73yL._SL200_.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Zach Weinersmith]]\n- Full Title: Polystate\n- Category: #books\n\n## Highlights\n- [[People will get their weed]]\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-14T22:41:44.98230565Z","tags":null},"/private/Readwise/Books/Red-Harvest":{"title":"","content":"# Red Harvest\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51xR3UQGr5L._SL200_.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Dashiell Hammett]]\n- Full Title: Red Harvest\n- Category: #books\n\n## Highlights\n- The first policeman I saw needed a shave.

The strike lasted eight months. Both sides bled plenty. The wobblies had to do their own bleeding. Old Elihu hired gunmen, strike-breakers, national guardsmen and even parts of the regular army, to do his. When the last skull had been cracked, the last rib kicked in, organized labor in Personville was a used firecracker. But, said Bill Quint, old Elihu didn’t know his Italian history. He won the strike, but he lost his hold on the city and the state. To beat the miners he had to let his hired thugs run wild. When the fight was over he couldn’t get rid of them. He had given his city to them and he wasn’t strong enough to take it away from them. Personville looked good to them and they took it over. They had won his strike for him and they took the city for their spoils. He couldn’t openly break with them. They had too much on him. He was responsible for all they had done during the strike.

Your judgment was made from your own point of view. If you liked a book simply because someone else praised it, that would be no different than retweeting a post on Twitter; nothing of you is there.

You might see something in it you forgot, and you might learn something unexpected about yourself.

He’s a strict-interpretation Epiphanist. Recites the Primes every night. A totally rigid mind.” “So he sees me—how?” “As a dangerous atheist.” “An atheist! Why?” “Why, because you’re an Odonian from Anarres—there’s no religion on Anarres.” “No religion? Are we stones, on Anarres?” “I mean established religion—churches, creeds—” Kimoe flustered easily. He had the physician’s brisk self-assurance, but Shevek continually upset it. All his explanations ended up, after two or three of Shevek’s questions, in floundering. Each took for granted certain relationships that the other could not even see. For instance, this curious matter of superiority, of relative height, was important to the Urrasti; they often used the word “higher” as a synonym for “better” in their writings, where an Anarresti would use “more central.” But what did being higher have to do with being foreign? It was one puzzle among hundreds. “I see,” he said now, another puzzle coming clear. “You admit no religion outside the churches, just as you admit no morality outside the laws. You know, I had not ever understood that, in all my reading of Urrasti books.” ([Location 230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B000FC11GA\u0026location=230))\n- Shevek turned the conversation, but he went on thinking about it. This matter of superiority and inferiority must be a central one in Urrasti social life.

I think I see how the rock actually does—” “That’s enough.” Some of the other children had been talking, but they stopped as if struck dumb. The little boy with the slate stood there in the silence. He looked frightened, and scowled. “Speech is sharing—a cooperative art. You’re not sharing, merely egoizing.” The thin, vigorous harmonies of the orchestra sounded down the hall. “You didn’t see that for yourself, it wasn’t spontaneous. I’ve read something very like it in a book.” Shevek stared at the director. “What book?

He was about twice as tall and three times as heavy as his opponent, and it was clear in his face that he disliked the child intensely; but there was no threat of physical violence in his stance, only an assertion of authority, a little weakened by his irritable response to the child’s odd question. “No! And stop egoizing!” Then he resumed his melodious pedantic tone: “This kind of thing is really directly contrary to what we’re after in a Speaking-and-Listening group. Speech is a two-way function. Shevek isn’t ready to understand that yet, as most of you are, and so his presence is disruptive to the group. You feel that yourself, don’t you, Shevek?

There was nothing to do. You’ve seen pictures of Odo in the prison cell in Drio, haven’t you? Image of defiant patience, bowed grey head, clenched hands, motionless in encroaching shadows. Sometimes prisoners were sentenced to work. Sentenced? Well, that means a judge, a person given power by the Law, ordered them to do some kind of physical labor. Ordered them? What if they didn’t want to do it? Well, they were forced to do it; if they didn’t work, they were beaten.

The solution to the tragedy of the commons isn’t to get a cop to make sure sociopaths aren’t overgrazing the land, or shunning anyone who does it, turning him into a pariah.

Worse, they were shleppers, their heavy outsized packs, many-pocketed trekking coats, and cargo pants stuffed to bulging. They looked overinflated. Shleppers were neurotic and probably destined to walkback within weeks, leaving behind lingering interpersonal upfuckednesses. Limpopo had gone walkaway the right way, with nothing more than clean underwear, which turned out to be superfluous.

She pretended as hard as she could that her friends weren’t noticing her bustling activity. The gift economy was not supposed to be a karmic ledger with your good deeds down one column and the ways you’d benefited from others down the other. The point of walkaways was living for abundance, and in abundance, why worry if you were putting in as much as you took out? But freeloaders were freeloaders, and there was no shortage of assholes who’d take all the best stuff or ruin things through thoughtlessness. People noticed. Assholes didn’t get invited to parties. No one went out of their way to look out for them. Even without a ledger, there was still a ledger, and Limpopo wanted to bank some good wishes and karma just in case.

It’s supposed to be emergent, natural homeostasis, right?” “I thought you might be clever. That’s it. Asking someone if you can pitch in is telling them that they’re in charge and deferring to their authority. Both are verboten. If you want to work, do something.

There’s a guy about two hundred miles that way”—she pointed south—“worth more than most countries, who is just organs and gray matter in a vat.

You’ve got one hundred times more nonhuman cells in your body than human ones. The people who live in that city are ninety-nine percent immortal rich-guy, extensions of his body.

That’s why you never hear politicians talking about ‘citizens,’ it’s all ‘taxpayers,’ as though the salient fact of your relationship to the state is how much you pay.

Older copies of the project will have a timestamp and the user name appended in the format ProjectName-YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS-UserName.prproj.\n\n##### Tags: ","lastmodified":"2022-06-14T22:41:44.990305693Z","tags":null},"/slowblink/Adobe-Premiere/Click-File-and-Open-Production-to-open-a-Production":{"title":"","content":"# Click File and Open Production to open a Production\n##### [[Adobe Productions Reference]] \u003e Click File and Open Production to open a Production | 06-14-2022\n\n## Open a production\n\u003e Do one of the following steps:\n\u003e -   From the Welcome screen or with a stand-alone project open choose File \u003e Open Production.\n\u003e -   Select a recently used production from the drop-down list.\n\u003e -   Click Open or click Browse and navigate to an existing production folder and choose it.\n\u003e ![](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/icons/xd_note.png) Unlike stand-alone project files, you can open only one production at a time.\n\n##### Tags: ","lastmodified":"2022-06-14T22:41:44.990305693Z","tags":null},"/slowblink/Adobe-Premiere/GPU-rendering-is-ideal-in-General-settings":{"title":"","content":"# GPU rendering is ideal in General settings\n##### [[Adobe Productions Reference]] \u003e GPU rendering is ideal in General settings | 06-14-2022\n\n\u003e The renderer setting applies to all systems that are working in the production.
