##### [[Adobe Productions Reference]] > Unlike preferences above, Production settings apply to everyone who interacts with the Production | 06-14-2022

The settings you choose for a Production apply to every project in the Productions folder. When collaborating inside a production, every editor sees the same shared settings for the production. To configure production settings, choose File > Production Settings.  Read on to understand what each setting means for a production. For general information on these settings, see [Review project settings](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/creating-changing-projects.html#review_project_settings)
