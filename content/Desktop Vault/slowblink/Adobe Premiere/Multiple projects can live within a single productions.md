> Individual editors can group related projects for improved organization and efficiency. Large projects (documentaries, films, TV) can be broken into reels or episodes where multiple editors collaborate according to their preferred workflow using shared storage network.

> The established Premiere Pro project format forms the basic building block of Productions. Productions add an additional layer, linking the projects and assets within them. A project within a Production retain all the attributes of a .pproj file. You can add existing Premiere Pro projects into a Production. If needed, you can remove them to use as self-standing Premiere Pro projects.
