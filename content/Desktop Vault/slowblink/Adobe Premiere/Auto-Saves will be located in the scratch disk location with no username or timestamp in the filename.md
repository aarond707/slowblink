# Auto-Saves will be located in the scratch disk location with no username or timestamp in the filename
##### [[Adobe Productions Reference]] > Auto-Saves will be located in the scratch disk location with no username or timestamp in the filename | 06-14-2022

The default value for all the scratch disks settings is Same as Production. It means that the folder that contains your production folder also contains your scratch disk folders. For editorial teams collaborating on shared storage, it is important that the scratch disk folders be set to a shared location that all edit systems can see.

Note:

If you must recover a file from Auto Save, navigate to the scratch disk location for Auto Save. Locate the project file that matches the name of the project you are looking for. There will always be one copy of the project with no user name or timestamp in the filename. This will always be the most recent Auto Save. Older copies of the project will have a timestamp and the user name appended in the format ProjectName-YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS-UserName.prproj.
