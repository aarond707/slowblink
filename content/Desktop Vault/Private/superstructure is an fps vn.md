One mode of [[superstructure]] has players moving to a new place, directly controlling the mech in [[Mech-Mode]], and the next mode in [[Pilot Mode]], in which the pilot is directly controlled moving through the interior of the mech, talking to NPCs. I would like to avoid interstitial menus between these two modes. Hard cuts between them would be awesome. Choices in the mech - which items to gain and which to give away - directly impact the choices within the mech; choosing who to talk to and give the item to while inside will affect who is talking to you in the mech interior, though possible in an inverse way, to get you to hear other characters you're not in touch with. Sometimes these could even be sendoffs, if you don't talk to them.
