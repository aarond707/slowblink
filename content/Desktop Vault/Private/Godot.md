# Godot Engine
Godot is the game engine I want to use for my game design projects moving forward. The scripting language is something I can grasp, and the [[node]]-based system also makes intuitive sense to me. Their business being open-source also sits well with me compared to alternatives like Unity or Unreal engines.

According to [[Ink - Official User's Guide]], Ink can be used as a scripting language in tandom with Godot to create dialog.
