Mods are the shit. They're so fucking weird, sometimes transformational, and generally just so individual and reflective of individual peoples desires, abilities, and resources. And sometimes, they're fun!

Nudity and sex mods are basically everywhere. [People want porn in their video games](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4412), and video games won't give it to them, so people are going to make their dreams come true. This is the constant in a landscape of infinite variables.

I like sorting mods by "last updated" on Nexus. I'm not filtering for quality as much as I'm filtering for what people are up as of five minutes ago. While this is excited on new games where it's amazing people have broken into it so fast to do so much, it's deeply fascinating with games that are ten to twenty years old - even moreso when they weren't even particularly popular games when they released.

There are memorials.

Sometimes you want to see [Keanu Reeves, smiling down upon you](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4533), while you talk to a robot designed to accurate emulate Keanu Reeves while you save sex with the emulation.
