[[the depths of the superstructure reveal its history]]

I got a cool building I put together in [[Crocotile 3D]] imported to the [[Workshop]] using GLTF format so that the skin's intact. I'd love to do some level design with it, but I'm not sure how I should handle collision modeling or whether I should export to [[Trenchbroom]], or whether that's even possible.

The other thing I did was get a button working - sort of. Right now, when I look at the cube and press E it prints the name of the button to the console. It also tells me when an interaction is possible, so that's neat; problem is, it doesn't go away. I also wanted it to work with left clicking, but that's not a huge deal.

I think i'm very close to rigging the lights to the button

Could [[Mech-Mode]] be the method of traversal in the [[overworld]] of [[superstructure]] while interior [[Pilot Mode]] is [[in-dungeon]] gameplay?
