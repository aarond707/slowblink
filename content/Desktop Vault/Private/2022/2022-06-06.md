I found [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKaPTdZKG8Y) on some useful ways to reference nodes in Godot that beat what I'm doing currently, although the primary method is only in Godot 3.5 and 4.0. Currently I'm on 4.4. 

I should give [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-eIEFPcvrU) a look too on getting started with spatial shaders. The same guy does [one on structuring projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0UQ-t-vuzY), which is something I desperately need now, since my workshop project structure is a god damn mess.

There's [another video](https://youtu.be/ya5BaDzcwkk) that I found a while back, but is especially relevant now about how to layer 2D over 3D. I need that for my crosshair system.

I'm also interested in all forms of procedural generation, especially in terms of how to make it happen in Godot, so I should [watch the video](https://youtu.be/3oZHzU6Mr2g) on that as well. I'm more specifically interested in how it can operate on text, but it's all nodes in the end.

For NPC people on the ground, I am going to [billboard 8-direction sprites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p0UFkQhJ_M).
