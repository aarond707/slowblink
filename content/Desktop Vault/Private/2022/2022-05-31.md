- [[MDQ22]]
	- [ ] Recap: 
		- we're waiting on footage to get delivered and hooked up by MPE
		- John and I met to hammer out details on our workflow
			- He walked me through multicam syncing and went over next steps for before and after we get the next drives.
		- I'm writing descriptions on footage we have so far
			- I was going to, but then we hit a hitch with our drive letters not being the same. If MPE can swap them for one of us, then we're good to go.
				- Wrote an email to support so I'm waiting to hear back.
					  They're changing John's drive letters so we're good now. Going to relink files with my drive letters.
