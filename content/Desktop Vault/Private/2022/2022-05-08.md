- I will often see these to do's after the fact. Asking myself about myself in the past tense might be more helpful than giving my future self commands. Instead of being presumptuous, I can settle for being correct. No wonder my past future selves have been so frustrated with me.
- [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/new-york-80e63b6f6ba44f2a9c841a84bd83614a) has some [awesome stuff](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/cyberpunk-laptop-6be01e731cd245d6909cbab1af0ad274). I want to try learning some more [3D art](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/p-o-s-t-c-o-n-t-a-c-t-a91e37f9ddec41ae8f436e58ac06e336) in general.
	- Free models [here](https://www.turbosquid.com/Search/3D-Models/free) and [here](https://free3d.com/) and [here](https://clara.io/library)
	- What happens when you run a 3D model through processing, between 3d printing to a 3d phone scan of that 3d print to a 3d phone scan, etc. #ideas 
- I found some decent threads on [[IT careers]] on reddit. 
- [[point and click interactions for project mech]]

- I started to go down a [rabbit hole](https://machinelearningmastery.com/start-here/) on machine learning, found [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/), which looks interesting, but I don't know much about it (different takes are [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/m712ui/is_freecodecamp_any_good/)). 
	- I ended up glancing at some [UX/UI course info](https://learnux.io/) and I'm curious about what careers in that field look like right now.
		- For whatever it's worth, I found an Adobe page on which [jobs](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/career-tips/ux-design-jobs-you-could-be-doing-in-2021/) are hot
	- [x] This is the thread on the state of IT in [May 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ui1ot6/may_2022_state_of_it_what_is_hot_trends_jobs/), so that's very up to the minute. I want to read that #todo 
- [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/) is the most diabolical fucking name and it needs to be parodied.
	- [SmartRent](https://www.salesforce.com/resources/articles/smartrent-delivers-seamless-prop-mgmt/?d=cta-jumbotron-1-ungated-smartrent_story) is the most evil fucking thing I've ever heard of. How is this real.
- [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/q-Ui-Ux-Designer-jobs.html?vjk=2cef5fcabe7485f9) seems like it might be quite a bit more tolerable than LinkedIn, although it won't get me completely untied from linkedin.
	- [Springboard](https://www.springboard.com/blog/design/types-of-ux-jobs/) seems useful too.
- Fonts are great and they're a great design influence. You can design architecture from fonts. They have design lineages that are worth looking into.
