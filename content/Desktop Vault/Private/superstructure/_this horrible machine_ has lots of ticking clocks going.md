[[_this horrible machine_]] has lots of ticking clocks going on that are nearly literal in the ship. Sometimes you're actually setting ticking clocks just to make sure you remember when to handle basic functions like walking or shooting or finding navigation data or food or supplies

clocks are physical objects that can be placed in specific locations and have their own looks and sounds and character, especially if npcs start borrowing those clocks
