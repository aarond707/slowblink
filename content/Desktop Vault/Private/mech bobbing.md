Mech bobbing is a function that makes the camera, and potentially [[mech head]], bob up and down while movement occurs.

The rate of bobbing should probably be modulated by the speed at which that movement occurs and only while in contact with the ground. Only controlled movement - not air movement or slide movement - should trigger mech bobbing.

I should use [[Private/AnimationPlayer]] to control this.
