## Highlights
- Books kept the feelings of isolation and loneliness from crushing me. ([Location 51](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0992SZT94&location=51))
- We are alone, but we are connected. ([Location 58](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0992SZT94&location=58))
- That is why I go to a bookstore every day. I keep going so that I may create new encounters. ([Location 69](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0992SZT94&location=69))
- Once my route becomes established, I stop seeing what lies beyond it. ([Location 86](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0992SZT94&location=86))
- Some will read the above and think, “Sure, but I can get that much from the internet.” But that’s not true. The information you see on the internet comes to you filtered and tailored to your personal likings and interests. In a bookstore, information of all types comes into your view passively as you browse, even on topics that you don’t follow. Bookstores create a broader context that doesn’t exist on the internet.

- There’s absolutely nothing wrong with disliking a book that someone else recommended to you. Your judgment was made from your own point of view. If you liked a book simply because someone else praised it, that would be no different than retweeting a post on Twitter; nothing of you is there.

- Once more, I take this opportunity to deliver these memes to you, in the hope that they may form a bridge between us. ■ ([Location 130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0992SZT94&location=130))
- As long as the possibility remains, I want their story to continue. Such is the fan’s mentality. ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0992SZT94&location=212))
- So take this opportunity to write a letter—to a relative whom you haven’t called on the phone lately, to a good friend you haven’t seen in a while, to a mentor with whom you only exchange holiday cards, to acquaintances you only contact through texting or social media. You don’t have to send it. You don’t need to stick on a stamp. You don’t even need to show it to anyone. Try writing a letter to no one in particular. You might see something in it you forgot, and you might learn something unexpected about yourself. ([Location 326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0992SZT94&location=326))
