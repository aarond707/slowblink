## Highlights
- So what should you do to get into entry-level IT? There are 4 credentials/qualities that hiring managers look for:
  4-year Degrees: No, they're not required. Yes, they will set you apart from those that don't have one.
  Experience - this is a big differentiator, but not a lot of people trying to break in will have experience yet. Internships are the exception - always, always, always do an internship before you graduate. Always.
  Certifications - great to have with or without a degree. In addition to a degree, they'll make you stand out more. If you don't have a degree, certs are the best way to show that you have tech knowledge.
  Attitude - this is an often overlooked but critical aspect of the interview process. You can be the smartest IT person in the room, but if you can't deal with people, you can't showcase your skills, or you can't display good soft skills, you're going to be passed over for someone else who can.
- Certs are the next most powerful tool to get you in line if you don't have a degree - the CompTIA ones are the baseline if you don't know what else to do.
  If you have no degree, no experience, no certs and want to break into IT, just ask yourself - what do you have to offer that people with those credentials don't have? If you don't know the answer, then you should probably look at certifications to start.
