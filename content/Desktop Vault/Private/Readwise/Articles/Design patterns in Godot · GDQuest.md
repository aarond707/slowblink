## Highlights
- Many built-in engine features in Godot make it so you do not need to implement many common patterns. For example, [[signals]] are the engine’s version of the Observer pattern, and [[nodes]] and their tree-like relationships allow you to favor composition over inheritance. Likewise, [[singletons]] are available in the form of auto-loaded [[nodes]].
