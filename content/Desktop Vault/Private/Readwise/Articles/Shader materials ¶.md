## Highlights
- Shader materials allow writing a custom shader directly, for maximum flexibility. Examples of this are:
  Create procedural textures.
  Create complex texture blending effects.
  Create animated materials, or materials that change over time.
  Create refractive effects or other advanced effects.
  Create special lighting shaders for more exotic materials.
  Animate vertices, like tree leaves or grass.
  Create custom particle code.
  And much more!
