## Highlights
- According to the [[materialist]] conception of history, the ultimately determining element in history is the production and reproduction of real life.
- The economic situation is the basis, but the various elements of the [[superstructure (concept)]] — political forms of the [[class]] struggle and its results, to wit: constitutions established by the victorious [[class]] after a successful battle, etc., juridical forms, and even the reflexes of all these actual struggles in the brains of the participants, political, juristic, philosophical theories, religious views and their further development into systems of dogmas — also exercise their influence upon the course of the historical struggles and in many cases preponderate in determining their form.
