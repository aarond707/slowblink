## Highlights
- In music theory, the circle of fifths is a way of organizing the 12 chromatic pitches as a sequence of perfect fifths.
- The circle of fifths organizes pitches in a sequence of perfect fifths, generally shown as a circle with the pitches (and their corresponding keys) in a clockwise progression. Musicians and composers often use the circle of fifths to describe the musical relationships between pitches. Its design is helpful in composing and harmonizing melodies, building chords, and modulating to different keys within a composition.[1]
- Using the system of just intonation, a perfect fifth consists of two pitches with a frequency ratio of 3:2, but generating a twelve perfect fifths in this way does not result in a return to the pitch class of the starting note. To adjust for this, instruments are generally tuned with the equal temperament system. Twelve equal-temperament fifths lead to a note exactly seven octaves above the initial toneâ€”this results in a perfect fifth that is equivalent to seven equal-temperament semitones.
