## Highlights
- A RayCast represents a line from its origin to its destination position, cast_to. It is used to query the 3D space in order to find the closest object along the path of the ray.
  RayCast can ignore some objects by adding them to the exception list via add_exception or by setting proper filtering with collision layers and masks.
  RayCast can be configured to report collisions with Areas (collide_with_areas) and/or PhysicsBodys (collide_with_bodies).
