## Highlights
- A-Life is the brain behind everything that happens within the fictional zone of alienation, which is a term used for the Chernobyl exclusion zone within the game and in real life. It controls how things happen and how things react around the [[player]]’s actions. There is a limit to this, however, and this is labelled as offline and online A-Life as a way to save from performance issues.
- Actions carried out by the [[player]] cause ripples through the actions of the AI, updating as the [[player]] traverses the world. The idea behind the simulation is to make it seem like AI between loading zones are moving and active. It works extremely well even though to some degree it is just smoke and mirrors from GSC Game World — a convincing simulation of how a human would react if put into the shoes of an NPC.
- A-Life has a natural function of branching to it. AI within Stalker has a set of rules it must follow based on NPC type and what their role is in relation to the [[player]]. Based on this, the AI will react in various ways. Due to how A-Life works, a cascading set of reactions can take place based on game events and what the [[player]] does.
  For example, if a bandit enemy is set on a random patrol in a group and is ambushed by the [[player]] yet doesn’t die, this Bandit has the possibility of joining another group or continuing on his original path.
  In addition to this example, if the [[player]] comes across the bandit wounded and is then healed by the [[player]], the previous rules change due to the relation to the [[player]] from an act of kindness.
- Compared to other AI, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. simulates human-like decision making. Instead of waiting for the [[player]] to enter the vicinity, the AI is proactive and based on certain rules will make decisions on their own.
- Online A-Life Status can be linked to all AI within a certain radius from the [[player]]’s location. Everything outside of this radius is considered Offline. The radius around the [[player]] in the vanilla, unmodded game is roughly 150 meters. This radius can vary — it has varied in the later games in the series but also has been changed via community modding. The A-Life system is working in the background and taking note of everything that happens in the Online so that it can make changes within the Offline AI.
- A-Life takes all the Online information that it has and makes changes to everything offline whilst the game time passes. The reason for this is that as the [[player]] progresses through the game, enemies & monsters move around in other places, meaning events can also occur away from the [[player]].
