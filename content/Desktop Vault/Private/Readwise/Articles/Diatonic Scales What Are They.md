## Highlights
- A diatonic scale is a type of music scale with seven notes (also called a heptonic scale).
  Diatonic scales must have two semitone intervals (half steps) and five tone intervals (whole steps) within one octave.
  The two semitone intervals should be separated by two and three tones.
  If you were to play all the white notes on a piano keyboard, starting on C you would have played a diatonic scale.
  Another thing that diatonic scales have in common is that they use all seven pitch letter names (A, B, C, D etc) in sequence without skipping any.
