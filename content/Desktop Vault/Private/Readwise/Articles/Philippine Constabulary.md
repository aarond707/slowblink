## Highlights
- The Philippine Constabulary (PC) was established on August 18, 1901, under the general supervision of the civil Governor-General of the Philippines, by the authority of Act. No. 175 of the Second Philippine Commission, to maintain peace, law, and order in the various provinces of the Philippine Islands.[3] By the end of 1901, a total of 180 officers had been commissioned.[4]
  The constabulary assisted the [[United States military]] in combating the remaining irreconcilable revolutionaries following the March 23 capture of General Emilio Aguinaldo and his April 1 pledge of allegiance to the [[United States]]. This phase of the Philippineâ€“American War ended in Luzon by 1906, with the surrender and execution of one of its last remaining generals, Macario Sakay.
