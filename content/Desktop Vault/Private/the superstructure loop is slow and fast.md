[[dynamic destruction can be achieved in a similar model to ladders in FPS template]]

You run around and choose what to fix, you give the mech very broad commands, and it very slowly does those things.

The [[superstructure]] loop should include this. This could be the combat phase, which I imagined in the fps controller. That could still exist at some point and interact with this, but I can also make a version without it.

I want to make a space that's just fun to move through at the speed you move through it. Or if I give the player a rhythm to engage with that makes short range traversal fun. Accuracy doesn't have to matter as much as rhythm. Part of the challenge of moving through a small space is like the challenge of moving by people in a kitchen who are also moving fast with dangerous parts.

Everything on the mech is broken. When you get things working, usually it's only for a little while.
