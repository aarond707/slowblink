To whom it may concern, I have chosen for Christian Ryan Deering to be covered on my insurance policy. He is not covered on any other insurance policy.

For context, Christian visited EXER Urgent Care on 8/25/2021. On 4/21/2022, EXER sent Christian a letter stating the following:

"EXER cannot bill your insurance for the services you received. Please help us by providing the information (...) Coordination of benefits"

According to the same letter from EXER, they will not submit billing for services rendered until updated information has been received by them. 

When Christian recently called Blue Shield, he was told that while he was the only other person listed on the insurance policy, he had not been updated on the policy for this year. This is an error that we need corrected as soon as possible.

Sincerely,
Timothy Deering
