Abstraction, as a game design tool, is powerful, but its power can cut both ways. It can create alienation, which can itself be good if intended. It can gloss over what needs to be glossed over, smooth over gaps in simulation in order to focus an experience. It is like cutting away when editing a film. It's explicitly artificial. [[Private/Readwise/Books/Games, Design and Play]] reference abstraction as a [[game design tool]].

>Let's look at [[abstraction]], another important game design tool. The most common way to think about [[abstraction]] in games is found with the abstract strategy game Go (see Figure 2.20). The board is a grid, the pieces simple black-and-white stones. In this case, [[abstraction]] refers to the fact that the game doesn't represent anything in particular. Compare this to the boardgame The Game of Life (see Figure 2.20), in which everything is representational-the little cars and passengers, the road and bridges, the buildings, and the money. Go embodies a kind of abstraction for games, but there are two other forms of abstraction game designers use to craft play experiences: abstraction of real-world activities, and abstraction of systems.
