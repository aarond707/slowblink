In what I'm calling circular dungeon design, and maybe should call fractal dungeon design, dungeons are sets of concentric circles within sets. This is an observation I picked up from [[Elden Ring]]'s open world and dungeon design.

This is an example of [[playspaces (gameplay)]]

A new dungeon, or circle of a dungeon you enter, could also simply be a path chosen in dialog that must be followed through in some way.
