Getting reductionistic about souls games for a moment here, but their gameplay is mostly built around management of meters. The most basic being HP. If we think of stamina as a sort of HP bar, it doesn't kill you when it has been reduced all the way, but it does make losing HP much easier by restricting all of your other potential actions. Poise is like an invisible HP meter, although in Sekiro they went ahead and made it visible because the game is built around it (and called it posture). But the rule there is that it measures damage taken _recently_, and also weighs certain types of damage more heavily than the others. The point being that meter management is mostly about knowing how to time actions depending the their combinations of states. A thing I'd like to try is stretching that gameplay loop onto a longer timescale and with greater commitment and consequence to actions. If you're running around inside of a big mech, you may need to run across a room or up some stairs to trigger an action to happen at the correct moment without always having the monitors you need to see in direct view. This could be a really cool way to riff on souls gameplay, and it would be achievable with what we know how to do, imo.
This is something I want to use in [[superstructure]]
