Dynamic destruction is awesome, and I think it's within my grasp. I could build an object like the ladder, and when it has all pieces it's complete, but I could have a line of semi-randomly sequenced nodes that disappear when it takes damage. Or the appearance of damage could indicate things that need to be taken care of.
