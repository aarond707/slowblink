The [[superstructure]] is my take on [[Blame!]]'s [[Megastructure]] for [[superstructure]]

The [[superstructure]] within the planet has infinite space within it, and infinitely more as one approaches the center. Some believe that one can never reach the center because you can only approach it forever. And some of them believe that the center may only be the only non-existant point of space in the universe.

People have explanations, but they're mythological. They would have to be made beautiful to be remembered were they not also the nightmares of [[madmen]].

> The [[superstructure]] is the hollowed and infinite interior of a machine planet. It is an automated complex of unending growth and consumption. It is a gravity well that has nearly pulled the universe inside out, and as [[The Last Star]] approaches, its fire envelops the sky.

It has Marxist connotations that I want to draw from, as we can read here: [[Private/Readwise/Articles/Letters Marx-Engels Correspondence 1890]]
