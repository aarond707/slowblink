Thematic rhythm can be a structure for storytelling, or a pattern for it. You show trends through repetition and the direction(s) in which it develops. At predictable, or intentionally unpredictable, intervals, you hit beats that demonstrate the same thing, but plot new points on an arc.

Often, [[elden ring characters are defined by their relationships to the powers above them]] which are both personified and literal representations of heaven and earth in conflict. These beats are hit with things bosses say, things NPCs say, things items say, and the progression is a constant escalation toward both the characters who exist in myth and legend as well as into the earth and heavens themselves.

Like how [[weak soldiers function as shield and crop]], the player dies again and again and falls deeper into the world of gods and finds them where they have entrenched themselves.
