To retrieve messages in [[superstructure]], you have to retrieve them through different media. Sometimes it's a heat scanner, sometimes analyzing waveforms. You're answering interpretive questions have the things you're experiencing, and that is message retrieval. 

Then you must transmit the message to others using one of the forms of media transmission, but it's always an abstract and imprecise tool. You pull from [[abstraction]], and you give back to [[abstraction]].
