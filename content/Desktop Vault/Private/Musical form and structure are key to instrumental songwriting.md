I've had trouble thinking of how or whether to even use structure in songs that are purely instrumental because verse and chorus mean something to me lyrically and only recently have they meant anything in terms of other musical character. But [there](https://music.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-write-a-theme--audio-22412) [are](https://music.tutsplus.com/tutorials/an-introduction-to-form-in-instrumental-music--audio-23381) [resources](https://www.randymcgraveymusic.com/post/song-structure-for-instrumental-music-sync-licensing) out there that actually talk about musical structure and form as it pertains to instrumental music - and of course there would be. I just didn't like researching, maybe?
