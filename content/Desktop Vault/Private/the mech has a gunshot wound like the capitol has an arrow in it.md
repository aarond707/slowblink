The mech itself has taken a massive shot directly through its torso, and it is dying. It is directing the humans operating it to a specific place, but won't say what's there. It the mech requesting to return to its final resting place? Is it leading them to some kind of salvation? Is it sending them to their deaths? Where did this machine come from, who made it, who was meant to operate it? There is no question of its sapience. That is assumed by all.

This is somewhat like how part of the level design in [[superstructure]] will be, and it's how it is in [[elden ring level design]].
