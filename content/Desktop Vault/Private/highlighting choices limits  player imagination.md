[[gameplay]] happens through actions and inactions and through choices among actions. When [[players (gameplay)]] are told that specific choices "matter" or "will be remembered", they are also being told that other choices matter less. Creating such a hierarchy discourages [[players (gameplay)]] from imagining and creating alternate worlds in their heads by showing too much of the framework in a game in favor of immediately gratifying a [[player]]'s desire for feedback.
