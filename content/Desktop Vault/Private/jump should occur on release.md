# jump should occur on release
##### [[2022-05-25]] > jump should occur on release | 05-25-2022

In [[superstructure]], the jump button currently triggers a jump at the moment it is pressed, and it does so with a static force. I want to jump only when the button is released, and the force should be modulated by the amount of time the button is held down. There should also be a cap on how long the button can be held.
