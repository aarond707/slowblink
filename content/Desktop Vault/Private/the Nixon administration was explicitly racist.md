> Some conservative political strategists admitted that appealing to racial fears and antagonisms was central to this strategy, though it had to be done surreptitiously. H.R. Haldeman, one of Nixon’s key advisers, recalls that Nixon himself deliberately pursued a Southern, racial strategy: “He ([[President Nixon]]) emphasized that you have to face the fact that the whole problem is really the blacks. The key is to devise a system that recognizes this while not appearing to.”51 ([Location 1030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0067NCQVU&location=1030))

The Nixon administration was overtly and explicitly racist, and it specifically targeted black people. [[White supremacy]] rules this country and has always ruled this country, and in the case of the Nixon administration, the fact is utterly plain.
