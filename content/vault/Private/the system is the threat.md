> While it initially appears that the Safeguard is the main antagonist of the series, it turns out that they aren't even malevolent. The Safeguard command lost control of the city's mechanisms and are responsible not only for Killy's appearance but provide him with whatever help they can. While there are certainly rotten people found within the City, there is no one single person responsible for any of it. In essence, the City itself, with its unchecked growth and rampant Safeguard creatures, is the only thing that can be considered the real threat.

The Safeguard is a product of a system and the City. That system is the enemy and the true animating evil force. In [[Private/Readwise/Books/Walkaway]], characters discuss the concept of [[diffused responsibility]] and how it is more the cause of capitalism's evil in the world than any narrative relying on the malevolence of individual bad actors.
