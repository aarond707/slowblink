To make a system where the player tunes a radio between stations, I need a dial that controls a float, tie a needle to the float as well as sort of granular states I can fade between.

The overall pitch is that the [[player character]] is in a basement listening to a radio, and some major event is happening outside. There are a few radio stations to tune between over the 15 minutes of the game, and they can be tuned between, but they gradually go dark one by one. At the end of the time, the game is over.

The idea is that you choose a strand of the story to follow, but those strands narrow as you progress.

Use the mouse wheel or clicking and dragging to turn the radio dial.
