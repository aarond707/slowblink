#fiction The youngest would-be knights get thrown onto the front line to see who doesn't die. Whoever survives gets tossed into a group that stands on the second line. With every survival comes promotion to safter positions, like exfoliating dead skin into the core of the body, packing it all into some incredibly dense space where everything falls into Forever's gravity.

The idea is that if unkillable ones surround themselves with unkillable ones then they will never die. That's partly true. It just backfires because unkillable ones all hanging out together want to do nothing more than kill each other while leaving everyone else to die.

[[thematic rhythm can be a storytelling structure]], and in this case, the ways in which survivors are elevated to use their trauma as a weapon to protect the powerful is a beat that can be hit over and over.
