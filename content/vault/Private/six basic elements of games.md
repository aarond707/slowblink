Macklin and Sharp claim that, "despite the many differences in games, we can identify the six basic elements in games" (7)
[[actions (gameplay)]]
[[goals (six basic elements of games)]]
[[rules (gameplay)]]
[[objects (gameplay)]]
[[playspaces (gameplay)]]
[[players (gameplay)]]

This is a useful as a kind of anchor for the rest of a game design to flow from. These should be set as constants early on.
