>A semitone, also called a [[half step]] or a half tone,[3] is the smallest musical [[interval]] commonly used in Western tonal music,[4] and it is considered the most dissonant[5] when sounded harmonically. It is defined as the interval between two adjacent notes in a 12-tone scale. For example, C is adjacent to Câ™¯; the interval between them is a semitone.

The [[Private/Readwise/Articles/Chromatic scale]] seperates all notes by the interval of a semitone.
