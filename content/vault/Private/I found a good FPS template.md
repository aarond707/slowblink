I just found a [first person template](https://milkandbanana.itch.io/godot-fps-template) on itch, which looks a lot better than whichever I started with for my project. It seems to have a rebindable controls system. It has some things like bobbing and interactions and lots of other params that could be useful. This belongs in the [[Godot Toolbox]].
