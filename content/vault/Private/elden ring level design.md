level design in [[Elden Ring]] is like sets of concentric circles that you can go deeper and deeper into, which I'm calling [[circular dungeon design]].

when you go to a deeper one, you also tend to commit further to seeing it through, but usually at the very end there is a unique reward

[[superstructure]] could do something similar in its level design
