In my life, traditions are something I've reflexively pushed away. They are routines I feel that I never consented to. Despite that, routines and rituals are something I've increasingly felt to be necessary in my own life. I've felt like I have come nearly full circle from identifying where my life feels messy and anxious to trying to solve for that by creating structures for what I cannot always analytically resolve in the moment. Structures outside of myself are what make up for a lack of mental energy. I need [[faith]] in what is out of my sight.
