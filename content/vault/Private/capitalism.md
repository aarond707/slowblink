Capitalism is the reason why [[good work]] is nearly impossible. If we don't have jobs, we don't just starve; we are killed (see [[unhoused genocide]]).

A lot of video games have come from indie developers in recent years that have been overtly critical of capitalism. One standout example being [[Kentucky Route Zero]], featuring the song [[This World Is Not My Home]], which repurposes rural American Christianity for revolutionary hope. KRZ shows us the ways in which [[familial relationships break down under the debt systems of capitalism]]. My attempt at something similar is [[superstructure]].

In music, [[Godspeed You! Black Emperor]] is a radical group that tells us "[[We're all trapped in the belly of this horrible machine]], and the machine is bleeding to death."
