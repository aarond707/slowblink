Browing for more stuff to put in the [[Godot Toolbox]]. I found a pack of [low poly people](https://www.cgtrader.com/3d-models/character/other/low-poly-people-pack-296-people) that I could use at least as references. I also found a [pack of low poly sci fi assets](https://spark3dvision.itch.io/low-poly-3d-assets) on itch. I don't want voxel stuff, so I'm filtering those results out. These are some [cool crates](https://idalgamestudio.itch.io/pixel-boxes-low-poly-free) and some [greebles](https://siris-pendrake.itch.io/low-poly-greeble-pack). We do love some good greebles.

Some of the stuff I'm adding isn't necessarily sci fi, but just [normal shit](https://toastyplanetgames.itch.io/modern-homes-pack) you've find in an apartment. Some of it is [industrial clutter](https://korrythecorn.itch.io/low-poly-drum-barrel-and-pallet). 

For characters, I also found this [base mesh](https://orange-juice-games.itch.io/psx-and-n64-male-base-mesh), which could be awesome if I can procedurally alter its shape for different characters.

This is a [c64](https://wavyaphid90518.itch.io/commodore-64), which is just rad. 

I also found this, [one of several "everything" libraries](https://davidoreilly.itch.io/everything-library-furnishings).

Also found lots of great [storage](https://brokenvector.itch.io/low-poly-storage-pack) models that could clutter the place.

Some of this stuff is specific to the [n64](https://craigsnedeker.itch.io/classic64-asset-library) aesthetic.

If I want character dialog, I need characters and I need dialog, and I need interactions with the characters to trigger the dialog.
