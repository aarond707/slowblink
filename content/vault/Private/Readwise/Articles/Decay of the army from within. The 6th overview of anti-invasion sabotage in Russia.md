## Highlights
- Russian liberal investigator Ruslan Leviev from the Conflict Intelligence Team also said a week ago about the refusal to re-go into battle from 20 to 40% of contract soldiers who fought in Ukraine and were withdrawn to the RF. According to him, not a single refuser in Russia has been prosecuted so far: only flight from the battlefield or collaboration with the enemy is considered "desertion". Refusal to re-participate in the "special operation" is a failure to comply with the order, the negative consequences of which still need to be proved for impution of the article of the Criminal Code to the [[objector]]. Several examples of such boycott leaked in some media - from the refusal of going to Ukraine by airborne paratroopers in Pskov (about 60 people in only one unit!) to homecoming by about 300 local and Russian combatants from the 4th military base in South Ossetia after the death of some fighter on a minefield and the commander’s prohibition to evacuate his body for burial. In the border regions, “a mass of reports of refusers has accumulated, there are already stacks up to the ceiling”, tells military lawyer and blogger Yuri Grebenyuk.
