## Highlights
- Answers to other questions that get asked all the time:
  No, you're not too old
  IT is a profession where you will have to deal with people. It's a customer-support role. Don't hope to get into IT so you can sit in front of a computer & never deal with people.
  Yes, your non-related bachelors degree is useful to have - you don't need to go back and get a technical bachelors/masters
  Yes, you can be successful without a degree
  Yes, you will be more successful and have an easier time if you do have a degree
  Given the choice, pick a non-security degree. Degrees should be general. If you're not sure, go with Computer Science - it's the most flexible tech degree you can get
  Start with the CompTIA certs if you don't know what to do
  No one cares that you built your own PC. That's not something you'll experience as an IT professional
  There are no jobs that are guaranteed to always be remote
  There are no specialties that are more likely to get you a fully remote job
  If you live in a somewhat rural area, you might have to move to get a job
  Yes, you'll probably have to start at a helpdesk / desktop support / L1 role. This is by far the highest volume of need within IT
  Yes, the money is good if you're good at your job. You can move up quickly if you're good at your job
  There are no jobs that will guarantee you $x salary in y years
  There are no certifications, degrees or other credentials that will guarantee you a job
  Competition is fierce these days. Prepare to send hundreds of resumes & go to dozens of interviews before you get an offer. You're not doing anything wrong - the market is flooded with applicants. Keep trying
- Special note on security: Unless you're coming from the military with active clearance, pick anything other than security to break into IT. 95% of people trying to get in want to do cyber-something, and there are very, very few entry-level security roles that exist. "But my school/neighbor/parent/whoever told me that there's huge need for security professionals in IT!" There is a huge need, but it's for high-level security professionals with years of experience.
