## Highlights
- But, also: Over 75 dead.
- At the core of many [[police]] stories, then, is something both aspirational and managerial: What sort of person deserves that power? How should it be used? What do we wish we could do—or flipped, what do we wish the police would stop doing? Sometimes that answer is material: A safer neighborhood; an old injustice brought to light; the end to the absurd and costly war on drugs. Sometimes the answer is more fantastic, more explosive: The libidinal freedom of Fastlane’s Bill Belamy leaping onto a car, Desert Eagles blaring [[violence]].
