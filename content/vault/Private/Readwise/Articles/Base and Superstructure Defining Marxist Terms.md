## Highlights
- [[Private/Readwise/Articles/Base and superstructure]] are two linked theoretical concepts developed by Karl [[Marx]], one of sociology's founders. Base refers to the production forces, or the materials and resources, that generate the goods society needs. Superstructure describes all other aspects of society.

    - Note: If, in [[superstructure]], there is a [[superstructure (concept)]], then what is the Base?
- Society's superstructure includes the [[culture]], [[ideology]], [[norms]], and [[identities]] that people inhabit.
- Based on the principles of Idealism, Hegel asserted that ideology determines social life, that people's thoughts shape the world around them. Considering the historical shifts production has undergone, especially the shift from feudalist to capitalist production, Hegelâ€™s theory did not satisfy [[Marx]].
