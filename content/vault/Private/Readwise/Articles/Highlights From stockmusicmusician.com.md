## Highlights
- Plate reverb is incredibly unique, as it came from a large, physical metal sheet hanging inside of a box. Plate reverbs, unlike rooms, aren’t made to mimic the acoustic of the real world. In fact, the plate reverb was the very first artificial reverb out there.
- There is nothing quite like the sound of a spring reverb. This is a type of reverb that isn’t made to emulate a space, but rather a mechanical device. Similar to a plate reverb, a spring reverb makes use of transducers, which produce the initial sound and drive it through the device. In this case, that device is a spring.
- Room reverb is the most basic type of reverb. Think of the room you’re in right now. It’s a space with walls, right? Of course, the room you’re in is probably very different than the room I am in writing this right now in terms of shape and size, even though we categorize them in the same way.
- As opposed to rooms, which are designed for living, sleeping, and entertaining without the preciousness of sound in mind, halls are designed with the goal of taking sound and expanding sounds into something long, lush, and majestic.
- Chambers are a wonderful middle ground between rooms and halls. Before the time of digital recording units lived a humble audio engineer with a small studio who dreamed of putting his or her music in a large, reverberant space.
- Ambience is quite unique, as it has a very short decay time, typically 0.5 seconds or lower. Ambience reverbs often use early reflections, creating a very faithful recreation of the emulated space. The main goal with an ambience reverb is to create an effect that is as dry as possible while adding a slight bit of space and color to the sound.
