## Highlights
- He had always feared that this would happen, more than he had ever feared death. To die is to lose the self and rejoin the rest. He had kept himself, and lost the rest. ([Location 109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC11GA&location=109))
- For hours or days he existed in a vacancy, a dry and wretched void without past or future. The walls stood tight about him. ([Location 153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC11GA&location=153))
- He said, “The door was locked.” “I’m sorry, Dr. Shevek—a precaution—contagion—keeping the others out—” “To lock out, to lock in, the same act,” Shevek said, looking down at the doctor with light, remote eyes. ([Location 178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC11GA&location=178))
- [[our wanton consumption is appalling]]
- “Oh, with him it’s religious bigotry. He’s a strict-interpretation Epiphanist. Recites the Primes every night. A totally rigid mind.” “So he sees me—how?” “As a dangerous atheist.” “An atheist! Why?” “Why, because you’re an Odonian from Anarres—there’s no religion on Anarres.” “No religion? Are we stones, on Anarres?” “I mean established religion—churches, creeds—” Kimoe flustered easily. He had the physician’s brisk self-assurance, but Shevek continually upset it. All his explanations ended up, after two or three of Shevek’s questions, in floundering. Each took for granted certain relationships that the other could not even see. For instance, this curious matter of superiority, of relative height, was important to the Urrasti; they often used the word “higher” as a synonym for “better” in their writings, where an Anarresti would use “more central.” But what did being higher have to do with being foreign? It was one puzzle among hundreds. “I see,” he said now, another puzzle coming clear. “You admit no religion outside the churches, just as you admit no morality outside the laws. You know, I had not ever understood that, in all my reading of Urrasti books.” ([Location 230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC11GA&location=230))
- Shevek turned the conversation, but he went on thinking about it. This matter of superiority and inferiority must be a central one in Urrasti social life. If to respect himself Kimoe had to consider half the human race as inferior to him, how then did women manage to respect themselves—did they consider men inferior? ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC11GA&location=282))
- His escorts took him into a building and to a room which, they explained, was “his.” ([Location 365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC11GA&location=365))
- [[possessive phrasing]]
- “It is not yours,” the one-eyed woman said with the mildness of utter certainty. “Nothing is yours. It is to use. It is to share. If you will not share it, you cannot use it.” And she picked the knobby baby up with gentle inexorable hands and set him aside, out of the square of sunlight. ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC11GA&location=407))
- “Who told you this idea?” “Nobody. I sort of saw it. I think I see how the rock actually does—” “That’s enough.” Some of the other children had been talking, but they stopped as if struck dumb. The little boy with the slate stood there in the silence. He looked frightened, and scowled. “Speech is sharing—a cooperative art. You’re not sharing, merely egoizing.” The thin, vigorous harmonies of the orchestra sounded down the hall. “You didn’t see that for yourself, it wasn’t spontaneous. I’ve read something very like it in a book.” Shevek stared at the director. “What book? Is there one here?” ([Location 437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC11GA&location=437))
- The director stood up. He was about twice as tall and three times as heavy as his opponent, and it was clear in his face that he disliked the child intensely; but there was no threat of physical violence in his stance, only an assertion of authority, a little weakened by his irritable response to the child’s odd question. “No! And stop egoizing!” Then he resumed his melodious pedantic tone: “This kind of thing is really directly contrary to what we’re after in a Speaking-and-Listening group. Speech is a two-way function. Shevek isn’t ready to understand that yet, as most of you are, and so his presence is disruptive to the group. You feel that yourself, don’t you, Shevek? I’d suggest that you find another group working on your level.” ([Location 445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC11GA&location=445))

- There was a singing in his ears which was not the orchestra but the noise that came when you kept yourself from crying; ([Location 453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC11GA&location=453))

- If a book were written all in numbers, it would be true. It would be just. Nothing said in words ever came out quite even. ([Location 461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC11GA&location=461))
- It was printed very full, with small characters and narrow margins; because paper is a substance that takes a lot of holum trees and a lot of human labor to make as the supplies dispenser at the learning center always remarked when you botched a page and went to get a new one. ([Location 477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC11GA&location=477))
- And when a circuit history teacher came through the town he expounded the subject, with the reluctance of a decent adult forced to explain an obscenity to children. Yes, he said, a prison was a place where a State put people who disobeyed its Laws. ([Location 508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC11GA&location=508))

- But why didn’t they just leave the place? They couldn’t leave, the doors were locked. Locked? Like the doors on a moving truck, so you don’t fall out, stupid! But what did they do inside one room all the time? Nothing. There was nothing to do. You’ve seen pictures of Odo in the prison cell in Drio, haven’t you? Image of defiant patience, bowed grey head, clenched hands, motionless in encroaching shadows. Sometimes prisoners were sentenced to work. Sentenced? Well, that means a judge, a person given power by the Law, ordered them to do some kind of physical labor. Ordered them? What if they didn’t want to do it? Well, they were forced to do it; if they didn’t work, they were beaten. ([Location 509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC11GA&location=509))
- Tirin asked the question that was in all their minds: “You mean, a lot of people would beat up one person?” “Yes.” “Why didn’t the others stop them?” “The guards had weapons. The prisoners did not,” the teacher said. He spoke with the violence of one forced to say the detestable, and embarrassed by it.

- “Forbidden? Nonorganic word. Who forbids? You’re externalizing the integrative function itself,” Shevek said, leaning forward and speaking with intensity. ([Location 677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC11GA&location=677))
- And that responsibility is our freedom. To avoid it, would be to lose our freedom. Would you really like to live in a society where you had no responsibility and no freedom, no choice, only the false option of obedience to the law, or disobedience followed by punishment? Would you really want to go to live in a prison?” ([Location 681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC11GA&location=681))
- “I stink.” “We all stink.” “In solidarity . . .” ([Location 719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC11GA&location=719))
- Wasn’t it immoral to do work you didn’t enjoy? ([Location 726](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC11GA&location=726))
- Their central function wasn’t being wasted. They were working: doing what they wanted to do. He was not working. He was being worked. ([Location 738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC11GA&location=738))

- “I haven’t really ever known anybody. You see how I didn’t understand you. I’m cut off. Can’t get in. Never will. It would be silly for me to think about a partnership. That sort of thing is for . . . for human beings. . . .” ([Location 754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC11GA&location=754))
- With timidity, not a sexual coyness but the shyness of respect, Gimar put her hand on his shoulder. She did not reassure him. She did not tell him he was like everybody else. She said, “I’ll never know anyone like you again, Shev. I never will forget you.” ([Location 757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC11GA&location=757))
- They were neither offended nor attracted by simple violence. Shevek did not call for help, so it was nobody’s business but his own. ([Location 768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC11GA&location=768))
- He and Shevet never spoke again. He saw the man at a distance, at other cookfires, without animosity. Shevet had given him what he had to give, and he had accepted the gift, though for a long time he never weighed it or considered its nature.

- Beshun, expert in delight, took him into the heart of sexuality, where there is no rancor and no ineptitude, where the two bodies striving to join each other annihilate the moment in their striving, and transcend the self, and transcend time. ([Location 777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC11GA&location=777))
- It would never (he thought, eighteen years old, sitting with a traveling-acquaintance in the truck depot of Tin Ore at midnight over a glass of sticky sweet fruit drink, waiting to hitch a ride on a convoy going north), it could never happen again. ([Location 805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC11GA&location=805))
- “I think men mostly have to learn to be anarchists. Women don’t have to learn.” ([Location 810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC11GA&location=810))
- But you should be free to find the line you want to follow. Stay here one more quarter, then go. And take care, in Abbenay. Keep free. Power inheres in a center. You’re going to the center. I don’t know Sabul well; I know nothing against him; but keep this in mind; you will be his man.” ([Location 865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC11GA&location=865))
- “What have you left, then? Isolation and despair! You’re denying brotherhood, Shevek!” the tall girl cried. “No—no, I’m not. I’m trying to say what I think brotherhood really is. It begins—it begins in shared pain.” “Then where does it end?” “I don’t know. I don’t know yet.” ([Location 935](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC11GA&location=935))
