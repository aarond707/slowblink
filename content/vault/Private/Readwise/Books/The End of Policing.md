## Highlights
- No correlation between the number of police and crime rates. ([Location 514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01I85OOZA&location=514))
- What is missing from this liberal approach is any critical assessment of what problems the state is asking the police to solve and whether the police are really the best suited to solve them. ([Location 532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01I85OOZA&location=532))
- [[Police exist to make sure they don't get TOO rowdy]]
- the basic function of managing the poor, foreign, and nonwhite on behalf of a system of economic and political inequality remains. ([Location 547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01I85OOZA&location=547))
- [[Peace Preservation Force is an absurd phrase]]
- The main functions of the new police, despite their claims of political neutrality, were to protect property, quell riots, put down strikes and other industrial actions, and produce a disciplined industrial work force. ([Location 569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01I85OOZA&location=569))
- [[Luddites fucking own]]
- The London model was imported into Boston in 1838 and spread through Northern cities over the next few decades. ([Location 577](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01I85OOZA&location=577))
- New York leapfrogged over Boston, creating an even larger and more formal police force in 1844. ([Location 583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01I85OOZA&location=583))
- These culminated in the formation of the Workingmen’s Party in 1829, which demanded a ten-hour day, ([Location 586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01I85OOZA&location=586))
- In response, newspapers began calling for a major expansion and professionalization of the watch, which ended with the formation of the police. ([Location 590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01I85OOZA&location=590))
- The next week the City Council responded by creating Chicago’s first official police force.13 ([Location 599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01I85OOZA&location=599))
- widespread enforcement of vice laws and even the criminal code possible for the first time. ([Location 601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01I85OOZA&location=601))
- America’s early urban police were both corrupt and incompetent. Officers were usually chosen based on political connections and bribery. There were no civil service exams or even formal training in most places. They were also used as a tool of political parties to suppress opposition voting and spy on and suppress workers’ organizations, meetings, and strikes. ([Location 606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01I85OOZA&location=606))
- Payments from gamblers and, later, bootleggers were a major source of income for officers, with payments increasing up the chain of command. This system of being “on the take” remained standard procedure in many major departments until the 1970s, when resistance emerged in the form of whistleblowers like Frank Serpico. ([Location 610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01I85OOZA&location=610))
- The primary jobs of early detectives were to spy on political radicals and other troublemakers and to replace private thief catchers, who recovered stolen goods for a reward. ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01I85OOZA&location=614))
- Alexander “Clubber” Williams ([Location 618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01I85OOZA&location=618))
- In some cases, early police forces were created specifically for purposes of suppressing workers’ movements. ([Location 627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01I85OOZA&location=627))
- The state’s initial response was to authorize a completely privatized police force called the Coal and Iron Police. ([Location 630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01I85OOZA&location=630))
- Local employers had only to pay a commission fee of one dollar per person to deputize anyone of their choosing as an official officer of the law. ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01I85OOZA&location=631))
- In the aftermath, political leaders and employers decided that a new system of labor management paid for out of the public coffers would be cheaper for them and have greater public legitimacy and effectiveness. ([Location 637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01I85OOZA&location=637))
    - Note: "new system of labor management"
- Pennsylvania State Police in 1905, the first state police force in the country. It was modeled after the Philippine Constabulary, ([Location 638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01I85OOZA&location=638))
- used to maintain the US occupation there, ([Location 639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01I85OOZA&location=639))
    - Note: maintain us occupation
- In Pennsylvania, this new paramilitary force represented an important shift of power away from local communities. ([Location 645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01I85OOZA&location=645))
- though often with less violence and greater legal and political authority. ([Location 647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01I85OOZA&location=647))
- Interestingly, many of the letters point out that the new state police routinely showed no interest in crime control, serving strictly as publicly financed strikebreakers. ([Location 652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01I85OOZA&location=652))
- Jesse Garwood, a major figure in the US occupation forces in the Philippines, ([Location 658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01I85OOZA&location=658))
- August Vollmer, after serving in the Philippines, became chief of police in Berkeley, California, and wrote the most influential textbook of modern policing. ([Location 660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01I85OOZA&location=660))
- Marine General Smedley Butler, who created the Haitian police and played a major role in the US occupation of Nicaragua, ([Location 662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01I85OOZA&location=662))
- Their main work was to hunt down native populations accused of attacking white settlers, as well as investigating crimes like cattle rustling. ([Location 677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01I85OOZA&location=677))
- In some cases, whites would raid cattle from Mexican ranches and then, when Mexican vaqueros tried to take them back, call in the Rangers to retrieve their “stolen property.” ([Location 680](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01I85OOZA&location=680))
    - Note: whites steal then call cops to protect their theft
- This intense violence was in part driven by separatists among the Mexican population of Texas who were tired of the constant usurpation of their lands, segregationist policies, and exclusion from the political process, all of which was enforced by the Rangers and local police. ([Location 692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01I85OOZA&location=692))
- These early police forces were derived not from the informal watch system as happened in the Northeast, but instead from slave patrols, and developed to prevent revolts. ([Location 717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01I85OOZA&location=717))
- The mere occasional riding about and general supervision of a patrol may be sufficient. But, some more energetic and scrutinizing system is absolutely necessary in cities, where from the very denseness of population and closely contiguous settlements there must be need of closer and more careful circumspection. ([Location 729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01I85OOZA&location=729))
    - Note: city vs rural division
      "urban"/"inner city"
      people who dwell in close quarters of cities cannot be trusted must be watched to make sure they don't organize, plot
