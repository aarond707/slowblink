## Highlights
- His whole identity rests on the idea that the system is legit and that he earned his position into it fair and square and everyone else is a whiner.” ([Location 676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FQQ47OC&location=676))
- Giving money away doesn’t solve anything. Asking the zottarich to redeem themselves by giving money away acknowledges that they deserve it all, should be in charge of deciding where it goes. It’s pretending that you can get rich without being a bandit. ([Location 692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FQQ47OC&location=692))
- “That’s creepy,” he said. “And cinematic. Do you really think [[zottas]] sit around a star chamber plotting how to separate the goats from the sheep?” “Of course not. Shit, if they did that, we could suicide-bomb the fuckers. I think this is an emergent outcome. It’s even more evil, because it exists in a zone of [[diffused responsibility]]: no one decides to imprison the poor in record numbers, it just happens as a consequence of tougher laws, less funding for legal aid, added expense in the appeals process.… There’s no person, decision, or political process you can blame. It’s systemic.” ([Location 1092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FQQ47OC&location=1092))

- Hubert, Etc was one of nature’s apologizers. A housemate once made a set of cardboard tombstones for Halloween, hung like bunting across the kitchen cabinets. Hubert, Etc’s read “Sorry.” ([Location 216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FQQ47OC&location=216))
- End of the day, anything that made you discount objective reality and assign a premium to some kind of internal mental state was going to be both pro-survival and pro–status-quo. ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FQQ47OC&location=255))
- “I’m suspicious of any plan to fix unfairness that starts with ‘step one, dismantle the entire system and replace it with a better one,’ especially if you can’t do anything else until step one is done. Of all the ways that people kid themselves into doing nothing, that one is the most self-serving.” ([Location 720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FQQ47OC&location=720))
- “It’s more than mere bullshit. It’s searing, evil, world-changing bullshit. The solution to the tragedy of the commons isn’t to get a cop to make sure sociopaths aren’t overgrazing the land, or shunning anyone who does it, turning him into a pariah. The solution is to let a robber-baron own the land that used to be everyone’s, because once he’s running it for profit, he’ll take exquisite care to generate profit forever.” ([Location 773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FQQ47OC&location=773))
- The initial theory had been that an error without a responsible party would be more socially graceful. People doubled down on their mistakes, especially when embarrassed in front of peers. The name-and-shame alternate versions had shown hot-cheeked fierce denial was the biggest impediment to standing up a building. ([Location 891](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FQQ47OC&location=891))
- That pretense—researchers called it “networked social disattention” but everyone else called it the “How’d that get there?” effect—was a vital shift in the UNHCR’s distributed shelter initiative. Prior to that, it had all been gamified to fuckery, with leaderboards for the most correct installs and best looters. Test builds were marred by angry confrontations and fistfights. ([Location 904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FQQ47OC&location=904))
- They were such obvious noobs they could have come from central casting. Worse, they were shleppers, their heavy outsized packs, many-pocketed trekking coats, and cargo pants stuffed to bulging. They looked overinflated. Shleppers were neurotic and probably destined to walkback within weeks, leaving behind lingering interpersonal upfuckednesses. Limpopo had gone walkaway the right way, with nothing more than clean underwear, which turned out to be superfluous. She tried not to prejudge these three, especially in that giddy first five minutes of her coffium buzz. She didn’t want to harsh her mellow. ([Location 938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FQQ47OC&location=938))
- I’m Limpopo. What do you want to be called?” ([Location 950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FQQ47OC&location=950))
- If there had been a leaderboard for the B&B that day, she’d have been embarrassingly off the charts. She pretended as hard as she could that her friends weren’t noticing her bustling activity. The gift economy was not supposed to be a karmic ledger with your good deeds down one column and the ways you’d benefited from others down the other. The point of walkaways was living for abundance, and in abundance, why worry if you were putting in as much as you took out? But freeloaders were freeloaders, and there was no shortage of assholes who’d take all the best stuff or ruin things through thoughtlessness. People noticed. Assholes didn’t get invited to parties. No one went out of their way to look out for them. Even without a ledger, there was still a ledger, and Limpopo wanted to bank some good wishes and karma just in case. ([Location 987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FQQ47OC&location=987))
- “You know that’s something you’re not supposed to ask?” “I got that impression. There’s something weird about you—I mean, us?—and work. You’re not supposed to covet a job, and you’re not supposed to look down your nose at slackers, and you’re not supposed to lionize someone who’s slaving. It’s supposed to be emergent, natural homeostasis, right?” “I thought you might be clever. That’s it. Asking someone if you can pitch in is telling them that they’re in charge and deferring to their authority. Both are verboten. If you want to work, do something. If it’s not helpful, maybe I’ll undo it later, or talk it over with you, or let it slide. It’s passive aggressive, but that’s walkaways. It’s not like there’s any hurry.” ([Location 998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FQQ47OC&location=998))
- “It doesn’t work at all in theory. In theory, we’re selfish assholes who want more than our neighbors, can’t be happy with a lot if someone else has a lot more. In theory, someone will walk into this place when no one’s around and take everything. In theory, it’s bullshit. This stuff only works in practice. In theory, it’s a mess.” ([Location 1027](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FQQ47OC&location=1027))
- Life extension comes at the expense of quality of life. There’s a guy about two hundred miles that way”—she pointed south—“worth more than most countries, who is just organs and gray matter in a vat. The vat’s in a fortified clinic and the clinic’s in a walled city. Everyone who works in that city shares that guy’s microbial nation. It’s a condition of employment. You’ve got one hundred times more nonhuman cells in your body than human ones. The people who live in that city are ninety-nine percent immortal rich-guy, extensions of his body. All they do is labor to figure out how to extend his life. Most of them went tops in their classes at the best unis in the world. Recruited out of school. Paid a wage that can’t be matched anywhere else. ([Location 1047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FQQ47OC&location=1047))
- The [[zottas]] are trying to secede from humanity. They don’t see their destiny as tied to ours. They think that they can politically, economically, and epidemiologically isolate themselves, take to high ground above the rising seas, breed their offspring by Harrier jets. ([Location 1073](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FQQ47OC&location=1073))
- That’s what walkaway is—not walking out on ‘society,’ but acknowledging that in zottaworld, we’re problems to be solved, not citizens. That’s why you never hear politicians talking about ‘citizens,’ it’s all ‘taxpayers,’ as though the salient fact of your relationship to the state is how much you pay. Like the state was a business and citizenship was a loyalty program that rewarded you for your custom with roads and health care. ([Location 1075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FQQ47OC&location=1075))
- “I live as though the [[zottas]] don’t believe they’re in my species, down to the inevitability of death and taxes, because they believe it. ([Location 1083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FQQ47OC&location=1083))
