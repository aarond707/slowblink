## Highlights
- All this seems to be so evident as to be hardly worth stating, except in answer to a man who doubts whether I know anything. ([Location 19](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000JQUFSM&location=19))
- Any one else who sees and feels and hears the table will agree with this description, so that it might seem as if no difficulty would arise; but as soon as we try to be more precise our troubles begin. ([Location 23](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000JQUFSM&location=23))
- the painter has to unlearn the habit of thinking that things seem to have the colour which common sense says they 'really' have, and to learn the habit of seeing things as they appear. Here we have already the beginning of one of the distinctions that cause most trouble in philosophy--the distinction between 'appearance' and 'reality', ([Location 29](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000JQUFSM&location=29))
- experience has taught us to construct the 'real' shape from the apparent shape, ([Location 51](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000JQUFSM&location=51))
- But the 'real' shape is not what we see; it is something inferred from what we see. ([Location 52](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000JQUFSM&location=52))
- Hence, two very difficult questions at once arise; namely, (1) Is there a real table at all? (2) If so, what sort of object can it be? ([Location 60](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000JQUFSM&location=60))
- Let us give the name of 'sense-data' to the things that are immediately known in sensation: ([Location 62](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000JQUFSM&location=62))
- The real table, if it exists, we will call a 'physical object'. ([Location 69](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000JQUFSM&location=69))
- Thus our two questions may be re-stated as follows: (1) Is there any such thing as matter? (2) If so, what is its nature? ([Location 70](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000JQUFSM&location=70))
- But Berkeley retains the merit of having shown that the existence of matter is capable of being denied without absurdity, ([Location 76](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000JQUFSM&location=76))
