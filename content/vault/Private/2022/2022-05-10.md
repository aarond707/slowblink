I started looking for more templates. Templates seem like the best way to learn how to do anything. People have already done it. Just do what they did and mash that shit together.

	This is an interesting point of reference for inspiration.
- [CyberPop - Interior Tiles by MalibuDarby](https://malibudarby.itch.io/cyberpop-interior-tiles)
	- Also a good reference point, but for different reasons. It has some really good broad stroke choices to look at, like the top and bottom separation of walls.
- [Classic64 Lowpoly Asset Library by craigsnedeker](https://craigsnedeker.itch.io/classic64-asset-library)
	- Really cool asset library of N64-style models.

- [[Elden Ring]], and other [[fromsoft]] games, have choices that you don't realize are choices. Or you do, but you may not know what the other options are. You will sometimes have the choice to give an object to a character or not, but they aren't telling you who else the object could be given to, whether this choice will go away, or perhaps even whether you will need the object for yourself in the future. The future significance of items is often hidden, or only revealed in the details of the item description.led in the details of the item description.
