I'm at the library deciding what to do here today. First I'll read a chapter of [[Games, Design and Play (2016)]]. 

I found some information on design thinking, which looks like a useful process. https://designthinking.ideo.com/

I'm thinking a bit about my next career, but I am also just trying to make myself feel okay with where I am right now.

I need to talk to my therapist. I worry that people see me making a huge mistake and instead of telling me that, they just tell me the things they think I need to hear to not sink further into it. But that's what therapy is too, isn't it? I have to believe that what I'm doing isn't a massive mistake. I need to believe that what I'm doing will work and that I will do the work that I need to do, otherwise I collapse.

That's all just what I tell myself. Collapse isn't absolute. I collapse and I build, and I do all of that all the time.
