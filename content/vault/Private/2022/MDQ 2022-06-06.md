I copied John's [[MDQ22]] project and I'm going to see how far I can sync the footage that's here, moving toward the 28th. Probably won't get that far.

		- One shot needs to be manually added because of a bad timecode
		- this shot probably is gonna need some more work. any time I add a piece, it either questionably fits or expands the requirements. I pulled in some audio that didn't seem to fit even though the time code seemed right
	- [x] 4 - nothing labled ✅ 2022-06-07
	- [x] 5 - nothing labled ✅ 2022-06-07

		- start - 19:23:42:07
		- end - 19:28:34:18
	- [x] 7 - 19:39:57:05 (slomo) ✅ 2022-06-07
		- start: 19:29:44:20
		- stop: 19:40:01:15
		- notes: this one seems to have bad timecodes. synching based on them didn't work, so I may need to find visual markers.
		- slomo is done, but is there non-slow version?
	- [x] 8 - 19:51:54:10 ✅ 2022-06-07
		- 19:51:52:05 to 19:56:29:05
		- notes: one audio track stretches pretty far out, but we're good otherwise
		- there's a shot that looks like a reshoot of the shoe bit, but closeup. I'm not sure how to align it, so I'm going to check with john about it
		- [ ] 8 (slomo)
	- [x] 9 - 20:35:29:06 ✅ 2022-06-07
		- 20:35:10:03 to 20:41:09:15
		- E001 seems to have footage with a bad timecode if it's labeled correctly. It looks like a lot from that camera is wrong.
		- [ ] slomo version
			- 
	- [x] 10 - 20:42:48:17
		- 20:43:56:18 to 20:47:28:06
		- audio was marked for take 11, assuming the audio timecode is accurate
		- the take number on the audio track is off, and the time code of one of the video takes is off
	- [x] 11 - not sure if this is a thing we have
	- [x] 12 - 21:26:29:13
		- 21:26:01:16 to 21:35:06:15
		- had two weird time codes
	- [x] 13 - nothing
	- [x] 14 - this stuff is all lumped together, so I'm gonna collect what I can that falls under the correct time markers
		- 21:34:22:00 to 21:56:25:00
	- [x] 15 - 


Can it be set up with proxies, and primary source location. Can I convert existing master project to team project.

collab workflow seems like it could be a ton of trouble. might be a bad way to go.

next on my to do is actually stringing together these sequences. I've marked the video shots I can mark, so I'll be marking sound and then making the sequences
