trying to orchestrate the biggest system collapse possible is fun and interesting, especially if the system is capable of reinstating itself

if it has cycle after cycle of boom and bust, you're not trying to make it bust, because that's part of it. you have to stop the cycle from occuring. possibly make it lose its inertia?

also the people in the mech are a bunch of weirdos who need to be coached into working together. the individualism of each cohabitant in the mech is both their collective strength and their weakness as people don't trust or respect each other. being the peacemaker within the mech is what makes it work. it's what makes the whole mission work. you have to mediate the conflicts between the people operating the too that will neutralize the [[superstructure (concept)]].

These are some thoughts about [[superstructure]] that I want to return to soon, specifically in how to make [[project mech NPCs]] special.
