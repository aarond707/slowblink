#projectmech 
One idea for [[superstructure]] is that the mech asks the [[player character]] what it is looking at, and the [[player]] can choose answers. this will shape what the mech describes to you about what it sees outside.

you don't get to see what is outside of the mech. you only get the reports from it on what it sees, and there are biases there. what is a machine told it sees? is it a combat machine or a logistics machine? how would it report that to a person, and how would the person feed back into that?

if you tell the mech that it is looking at something horrible, or something beautiful, or something good or evil, would that change how it behaves, or simply what it reports back to you?

from within, you are trying to understand what it is saying about the outside through the lens of the definitions you give it, but in so doing you create your own lie.
