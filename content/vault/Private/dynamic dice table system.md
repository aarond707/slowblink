dynamic dice table system where you can make lists of things and the number of rolls navigates the [[player]] from something less specific to something more specific by creating choice rules, or constraints, for the [[player]] with each roll of a d10.

puppies
bracnhes
alcoholics
kittens
killers
robots

the prompt could tell me to choose the discard every choice with that feels wrong for the thing I am trying to get at. it must do this by having the [[player]] make objective choices, or by making the [[player]] make subjective choices, then objective choices based on the subjective choice.

this is how you lead someone to a choice they didn't realize they could or would make.
