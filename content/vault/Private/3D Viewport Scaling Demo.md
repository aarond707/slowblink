# 3D Viewport Scaling Demo
##### [[Godot Toolbox]] > 3D Viewport Scaling Demo | 05-19-2022

This demo shows how to scale the 3D viewport rendering without affecting 2D elements such as the HUD. This is really cool for creating a pixelated effect, especially if I am creating small in-world monitors using viewports.

I'm considering using viewport scaling to force a pixelated resolution in [[superstructure]], but I'm going to try it out in [[Workshop]] first.
