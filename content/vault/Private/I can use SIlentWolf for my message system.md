# I can use SIlentWolf for my message system

I'm looking at a tutorial for [SilentWolf](https://silentwolf.com/) as a leaderboard system, but what I really want is a [[Dark Souls]]-like [[message system]]. Previously I thought [[souls messages need SQL]], and that's probably still happening on the back end here, but not in a way that I have to interact with directly. I found it throught [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DmWvSuuKPw). I created an account for it using my drspaceman707@gmail.com email address.
