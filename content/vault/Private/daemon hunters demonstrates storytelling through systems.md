The requisition point system encourages brutal cuts to your team in [[Warhammer 40k Chaos Gate Daemonhunters]]. I sent two [[space marines]] back to HQ because they were wounded so that I could recruit one new space marine who wasn't hurt. I did this so that I could win points with the boss (and requisition points). This is storytelling through game mechanics. Clearly, [[weak soldiers function as shield and crop]] to the imperium of man. Likewise, [[Vakir responds to player actions in fiction and mechanics]].
