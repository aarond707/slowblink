We don't understand things that are infinite. The concept is something we understand because we have to allow for it, not because we've ever encountered it. It makes us feel insignificant and vulnerable and lost. We don't even know how to position ourselves in relation to it. When we encounter infinite spaces, we have a fear which is difficult to place.
