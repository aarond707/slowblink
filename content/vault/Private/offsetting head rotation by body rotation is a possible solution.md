What if I just have a variable that starts with the initial rotation value of the head, and that gets directly modified by the mouse? I still probably have the problem I've been having, but then I can keep it offset by the rotation of the parent as well, and then I just mind the head to the rotation of that variable. The [[mech head]] should then turn the way I want it to.
