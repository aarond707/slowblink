Combat encounters in [[superstructure]] can be a slow bleed that sounds like a thousand bees make of howitzer shells outside your apartment door and window. That's how high up you are. That's how shitty the drywall is. That's how many people are inside with you. That who you have to take care of. That's who you're fucking stuck with. That's who won't do the dishes. That's who paid late but is the expert mediator. That's who's been on-again/off-again dating with the boyfriend who's here but doesn't live here. That's the charismatic one who fucking scares you.
