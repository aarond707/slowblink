##### [[_this horrible machine_]] > poem | 06-12-2022

and much like that unpublished film script/poem, 

it's just a poem, 

actually. 

it's just a post, 
it's just a novel, 
it's just an unsent email in the drafts folder, 
it's just a sick sample in an unpublished soundcloud upload that really isn't even a finished song if you think about it.


_And the machine is bleeding to death
The sun has fallen down
And the billboards are all leering
And the flags are all dead at the top of their poles
