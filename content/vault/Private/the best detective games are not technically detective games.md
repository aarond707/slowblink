Some of the best games to put the [[player]] into the experience of being a [[detective]] are not games where you are actually in the literal role of a [[detective]], but that give the [[player]] satisfying investigative tasks.

[[The Outer Wilds]] and [[Return of the Obra Dinn]] are both examples of this.
