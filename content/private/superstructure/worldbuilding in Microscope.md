# Big Picture
Humanity struggles to survive in the SUPERSTRUCTURE, a virtually infinite universe contained beneath the surface of a mechanical planet.

# Periods
* The Birth of the Superstructure (Dark | Start)
* The Collapse of the Superstructure (Light | End)

What we'll do first is fill in the palette. This is a cool process because it sort of sculpts an exact tone/theme/genre space that we are playing in. In the book's words:

> The Palette is a list of things the players agree to reserve the right to include or, conversely, outright ban. It gets everyone on the same page about what belongs in the history and what doesn’t.

> Add something to the Yes column if you think the other players would not expect it to be in the history, but you want to be able to include it. 

> Add something to the No column if you think the other players would expect it to be in the history, but you don’t want it included. Players can go in any order. You don’t have to add anything to the Palette if you don’t want to.

The book says to create columns, but for our purposes we'll just write it in chat here.
