_The car's on fire, and there's no driver at the wheel_

a game wherein you keep a dying mech alive while caring for the people within it while letting them care for you and each other
it takes place within the [[superstructure]] in a mech created by it

_And the sewers are all muddied with a thousand lonely suicides_

so you move together and live together like housemates who are here because you have nowhere else

[[_And a dark wind blows_]]

[[_the government is corrupt_]]

_And we're on so many drugs_

we print them ourselves as when needed and wanted 
as long as we still have the feedstock

_With the radio on and the curtains drawn_

[[superstructure is small in scope but with big windows out]]

_We're trapped in the belly of_

# _this horrible machine_
the unfinished [[script=poem]] for _Incomplete Movie about Jail_ by a member of guitarist EFRIM MENUCK of [[band=prophets]] [[Godspeed You! Black Emperor]]

_It went like this:

one plute won the world 

_The buildings toppled in on themselves

more buildings stand tall behind and above them

but the next world slipped
he threatened everyone who could not give him immortality
with a universe of hell

_Picked through the rubble

but [[capitalism]] wasn't his tool
it was his owner
it became his prison too

_And pulled out their hair

the unfortunate remnants of humanity get to die
but never the [[job creator]]

_The skyline was beautiful on fire
_All twisted metal stretching upwards
_Everything washed in a thin orange haze

parts of [[ground zero=first flame]] are said to still be on fire despite the events having taken place millenia ago

_I said, "Kiss me, you're beautiful -
These are truly the last days"

in our last moments we connect and we love

_You grabbed my hand
And we fell into it
Like a daydream
Or a fever_

[[the player in superstructure is a comrade]]

_We woke up one morning and fell a little further down
For sure it's the valley of death
I open up my wallet
_And it's full of blood

so nobody has the heart to do much beyond barter

this photo is something that could be achieved using photoshop
the hardcornered shape and the [tornado](https://youtu.be/LnkMSmLc6mM) spout look like sign and post

take indistinct photographs and photoshop similarlyshaped things from other indistinct photographs 
they only need to be degraded similarly to appear natural together
some desaturation and colorization and film grain go a long way
