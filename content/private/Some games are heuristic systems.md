Microscope is the first game that comes to mind as a heuristic system for developing a setting rapidly. It is a [[ttrpg]] where the player does not control one particular [[player character]], but instead shares equal influence over the history of a setting with other players.

I want to use Microscope for developing the setting in [[superstructure]].
