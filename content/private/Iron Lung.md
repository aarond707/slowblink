Iron Lung is a game where you pilot a submarine. The playspace is the submarine itself and the trenches the submarine moves through. You're in both of these spaces, though movement within the submarine is less vital than the movement through the trench, which you have a clumsy amount of control over. The clumsiness of the controls is what makes the tactile experience of piloting work so well. The emergencies that happen on the sub are not varied, but they are varied enough for how short the experience is.

The sound design of things happening outside of the sub are what make the game work so well.

[[superstructure]] is going to use some of it as an touchstone.
