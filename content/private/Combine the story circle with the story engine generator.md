[[dan harmon's story circle is a good ripoff]] of the monomyth. Or rather, it's a very useful reframing of it. Using the [[Story Engine]] system, I want to combine the two for more robust generation of narratives.

The Story Engine system uses the following components for generating fiction: [[conflict card]], [[anchor card]], [[engine card]], [[agent card]], [[aspect card]]. 

If I map the story above to the cards, I could start with this story told with the template.

(AGENT)Rick and Morty
(ENGINE) want to obtain a thing from 
(ANCHOR) some weird alternate universe
(CONFLICT) but Morty has to die and bury himself
(ASPECT) having changed, gaining an eyepatch and trauma

1. [[They are in a zone of comfort]]
The [[aspect card]] can also be used to describe the place of comfort. It might be two seperate draws to get that. 

2. [[But they want something]]
The engine card gives us this, to an extent. There could be more detail required.
The change is likely a direct result of the adaptation made, a non-obvious
