Meeting notes
		- Quince day had rougher slates
		- Music was a mix of licensed and unlicensed music
		- Dance scenes have pop songs that are probably unlicenced
		- 10 episodes, editors will leapfrog
		- "Queer Eye" format
			- Lean into funny or ridiculous moments
		- Interviews not shot yet
		- Romi will probably have the least footage
		- We'll triplicate footage and remove whoever isn't the girl for the selected project.
		- Sound on quince day is rougher
		- They always have room tone
