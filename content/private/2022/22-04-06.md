I'm trying to get a [[Godot]] project set up again. It's hot and I'm uncomfortable. My neck hurts and I'm listening to weird music. My room is a mess, my laundry hasn't been put away, and I already want to take a second shower. I got out of bed late, and I'm afraid that the very little I've done is all I will be able to do day after day until my days run out.

[[Qodot]] is installed, though. Let's import.
