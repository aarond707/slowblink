## Highlights
- Just as VisualScript is an alternative for users that prefer a graphical approach to coding, VisualShaders are the visual alternative for creating shaders.
- As shaders are inherently linked to visuals, the graph-based approach with previews of textures, materials, etc. offers a lot of additional convenience compared to purely script-based shaders. On the other hand, VisualShaders do not expose all features of the shader script and using both in parallel might be necessary for specific effects.
- Creating a VisualShader¶
  VisualShaders can be created in any ShaderMaterial. To begin using VisualShaders, create a new ShaderMaterial in an object of your choice.
