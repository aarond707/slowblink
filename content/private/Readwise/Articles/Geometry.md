## Highlights
- The Inverse Scale Factor property on a [[QodotMap]] [[node]] determines the ratio between Quake units (used in TrenchBroom and other editors) to Godotâ€™s [[metric coordinate system]]. All Quake coordinates are divided by this value to create [[Godot]] coordinates during build.
- [[Trenchbroom]] maps are built on a grid, so trying to create curves, arches, and tunnels can be challenging. Luckily, Quake Builder is a YouTube channel with a wide array of videos that cover advanced mapping topics in Trenchbroom.
