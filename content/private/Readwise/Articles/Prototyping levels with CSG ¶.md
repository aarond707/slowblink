## Highlights
- Every CSG node will first process its children [[nodes]] and their operations: union, intersection or subtraction, in tree order, and apply them to itself one after the other.
- The default lighting of the environment doesn't provide clear shading at some angles. Change the display mode using Display Overdraw in the 3D viewport menu, or add a DirectionalLight node to help you see clearly.
