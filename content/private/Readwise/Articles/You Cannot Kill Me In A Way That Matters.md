## Highlights
- Around June 15th, 2018, Tumblr user personsonable posted a three-paragraph story about a person asking a mushroom for the name of God under gunpoint, to which the mushroom replies by taunting its supremacy, terrifying and enraging the person.

  In a series of replies that often accompanies screenshots of the post, personsonable explains that meaning behind the story:
  miaislying: Hey OP? What the FUCK does this mean?
  personsonable: decay exists as an extant form of life
  miaislying: That’s a terrifying answer, have a nice day
  The post gained over 116,000 notes in two weeks, but was deleted around 2019 and only indirectly archived.[1]
