## Highlights
- We also planned that our characters would be able to uncover the mystery of the Zone before the [[player]], or at least collect a certain amount of information. Then we changed the way quests were generated. Characters would now get quests not from dealers, but from the so-called smart terrains. A character’s life now worked in such a way, that he took the quest generated by some smart terrain, then walked to the destination it had set for him. After getting there, he would get points, and the smart terrain would take him under control for some time. Under the control of a smart terrain, the character prioritized and carried out the available tasks. This is how the game got faction bases, stalkers by campfires, and such. That is, migration of characters from place to place, their movement between levels, all was caused by changing goals.
- In retrospect, what parts of the system and/or development process were you particularly happy with? DI: I was very happy with the work done when I followed a stalker from one level to another, saw how he searched for artifacts, found them, returned to the dealer, approached him, traded, picked a new quest, went on — too bad this did not make it into the original game. It was very interesting to witness. When we were implementing goal-oriented action planning, it was very interesting to watch two hostile unarmed characters that knew were to get weapons and ammo: they first run to the weapons, find that they have no ammo, then run to the ammo, the first one to get there causes the other to panic if he is still far away from weapons and ammo, the panicking character gets wounded and falls, the other approaches to finish him (this did not make it into the original game, since all characters received unlimited ammo, and such situations could not take place). It was very interesting to watch a fight of several dogs and one stalker — it was breathtaking to see this sight, as he flees the dogs, switching covers. Sometimes he died quickly, sometimes managed to take down 4-5 dogs, and sometimes all 6.
- Do not reinvent the wheel. Use the internet to find solutions to your problems.
- Have a clear idea of the game you are making, of which features it will have and which it will not, use prototyping to avoid implementing features that do not make it into the release.
- Debug characters with comfortable tools: each component should have its debug draw/mode/screen. Draw paths (all the iterations, all the smooth stages and so on), draw visibility checks to find out why character doesn’t see, draw covers information and so on. To debug characters' behavior we created their debug screen with all the data from all the layers, so we can easily pick the character and find out what is wrong with him. Pause and time factor are invaluable for the animation/movement/orientation debug.
- Let programmers do programmer work and designers design. Designer is a bad programmer, programmer is a bad designer. This could become a problem when using scripts. Let people do things in which they are strong. Instead of advancing designers in programming, create WYSIWYP editor with many options to tune.
- Be aware of all the new developments in your area, read Internet resources, like AIGameDev.com.
- Implement something new in your game. Maybe it is only one thing (since several can be too much for a single project), but necessarily new. We see an excellent implementation of decision trees in Black & White, Jeff Orkin has created an exceptional implementation of a goal-oriented action planner in F.E.A.R., we have tried to make a kind of approximated A-Life in a shooter, maybe someone will make something new tomorrow — this will benefit the players, who will get diverse games, and developers themselves, who will set an example of a good method or approach.
