## Highlights
- The first policeman I saw needed a shave. The second had a couple of buttons off his shabby uniform. The third stood in the center of the city’s main intersection—Broadway and Union Street—directing traffic, with a cigar in one corner of his mouth. After that I stopped checking them up.

- “Really? How do you like our city?” “I haven’t seen enough of it to know.” That was a lie. I had. “I got in only this afternoon.” ([Location 48](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G8P2M8&location=48))
- “It’s inconsiderate of Donald to bring you out here and then keep you waiting, at this time of night, long after business hours.” I said that was all right. ([Location 52](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G8P2M8&location=52))
    - Note: A lot of his dialog is narrated over rather than delivered in direct quotes.
- I let her get whatever she could out of a grin. ([Location 57](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G8P2M8&location=57))
- I said I would get in touch with him at the Herald in the morning. I went away wondering why the green toe of her left slipper was dark and damp with something that could have been blood. ([Location 71](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G8P2M8&location=71))
    - Note: This book loves to tell rather than show.
- “Don Willsson’s gone to sit on the right hand of God, if God don’t mind looking at bullet holes.” “Who shot him?” I asked. The gray man scratched the back of his neck and said: “Somebody with a gun.” ([Location 81](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G8P2M8&location=81))
- “I’m a stranger in town. Hang the Punch and Judy on me. That’s what strangers are for.” ([Location 84](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G8P2M8&location=84))
- They struck. The strike lasted eight months. Both sides bled plenty. The wobblies had to do their own bleeding. Old Elihu hired gunmen, strike-breakers, national guardsmen and even parts of the regular army, to do his. When the last skull had been cracked, the last rib kicked in, organized labor in Personville was a used firecracker. But, said Bill Quint, old Elihu didn’t know his Italian history. He won the strike, but he lost his hold on the city and the state. To beat the miners he had to let his hired thugs run wild. When the fight was over he couldn’t get rid of them. He had given his city to them and he wasn’t strong enough to take it away from them. Personville looked good to them and they took it over. They had won his strike for him and they took the city for their spoils. He couldn’t openly break with them. They had too much on him. He was responsible for all they had done during the strike.
