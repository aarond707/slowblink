## Highlights
- When talking about constraint and goals, we're more often than not thinking about the actions players perform during play. [[Immersive sims are often defined by indirect actions]].
## New highlights added May 17, 2022 at 7:18 AM
- Sometimes the goals are quantifiable, and therefore strong, while in other cases, they are experiential and loose. Without a goal, players won't know to what end they are following the rules. Soccer is an example of a quantifiable, and therefore strong, goal-one that guides and gives purpose to the play experience. On the other end of the spectrum is Jane Friedhoff's Slam City Oracles (see Figure 2.7). Players take on the role of one of two young girls in a world filled with snack food, fantastic buildings, pinwheels, and other quirky objects. The goal? Bounce around the environment with a friend, and in the process knock things around-riot grrrls in a perfectly playful world. The player can bounce higher and higher or just stick around one area and slam to their heart's content. While there is a score, it is intentionally complex with absurdly high numbers that provide humor more than a measure of player performance. For a player of Slam City Oracles, the outcome isn't the focus; it's the process of getting there and the different things that happen along the way.
- Goals are a really useful tool for game designers. They are one of the only ways we can guide players' experiences in engaging with the actions, objects, and playspaces we design. A game's goal frames the play experience, suggesting to players how they might engage the game. The goals shape the space of possibility for players. A game's goals also shape how players perceive the available actions and objects within the playspace. Do they approach them as a means to an end or simply as an experience unto themselves?
- Challenge One of the things that designers use to craft a player's experience of trying to reach their goal is challenge. All games provide some level of challenge, even if the players provide it themselves.
  Challenge is often described in relation to the psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's idea of the flow state.? For Csikszentmihalyi, flow is described as a state of high focus and enjoyment.
  Perhaps most famous is his chart of the flow state, showing the "flow channel" between anxiety and boredom, rising with skill and challenge (see Figure 2.10).
- Many game designers use the concept of flow state to describe an ideal difficulty for level design, increasing the challenge to fit evolving player skill by just the right amount to avoid ien increasing the challenge to fit evolving player skill by just the right amount to avoid cniking into the anxiety zone or plummeting toward boredom.
  Certainly, flow can be a useful concept for game designers, but here's a word of caution about she idea of flow. It can be tempting to correlate a state of flow with good game design, but just as many movies might provide us with an escape from ordinary life or a happy ending, not all movies need to be that way. Sometimes great films are made about ordinary life; or their endings aren't happy. For games, flow is a response to challenge meeting the player's skill level, and it creates a kind of play that can be highly satisfying. But equally satisfying are games that don't challenge players' skill. Instead, the game might confront the player with a challenging narrative or an experience that the player can enjoy regardless of skill. So, flow can be experienced in games, but it's not the only kind of experience players can have in games, and it's not better
- Decision-Making and Feedback There are two related game design tools to consider when thinking about how players understand a game's state: the decision-making and feedback that propel a player through their play experience. Let's use bicycles as an example here. For a bike to go forward, the rider bas to pedal it. But while doing the pedaling, the rider is making hundreds of decisions every second-how fast should they go? Which direction should they head? Are there cars, pedestrians, or other cyclists to keep an eye on? While operating a bicycle, the rider has to make lots of decisions.
  Games also require that players constantly evaluate what is happening while continuing to carry out their actions in the game. This is what Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman refer to as the "action-outcome unit."5 All play experiences are made of a sequence of actions-pedal the bike-that have outcomes-the bike moves forward-that lead to the next action-turn the handle bars-that lead to the next outcome-the bike turns left. Ultimately, this is what gameplay is made up of: dozens, even hundreds or thousands, of small decisions that each creates a change in the game's state. From these, play experiences emerge, shaped along the way by the goals and subgoals, however loose or strong they might be.
- [[abstraction]]
- Theme The next basic game design tool is theme. A game's theme is the logical framework for how the game represents itself. Designers use it to shape the player experience and help them understand the game more quickly and intuitively.
  Take chess as an example again. Chess doesn't have a story, at least not an implicit one. In fact, when we talk about chess, many people call it an abstract strategy game. (The abstract in abstract strategy game refers to the game not having representational qualities, similar to Go.)
- [[Kentucky Route Zero]] by Cardboard Computer (see Figure 2.24) represents yet another use of theme in games. It has a very strong theme in terms of its mood, its art style, and its interaction model. The player is an observer on a storyworld centering on a truck driver named Conway who travels along the eponymous [[Kentucky Route Zero]]. The game draws on old graphic text adventures and point-and-click adventure games combined with a clean, minimal illustration style and cinematic animations. While the interactivity and the story of [[Kentucky Route Zero]] are not as tightly coupled to theme as they are in Way, they do work well together to create an atmospheric play experience. Everything about the sensory elements of the game supports the moody, magical story inside the game. [[Kentucky Route Zero]] explores an aesthetic theme that envelopes the player in a space of possibility more focused on atmosphere and narrative.
- Storytelling This brings us to the next game design tool: storytelling. Often, a game's theme is embedded in its story, as happens with film, comics, literature, and more. Many games are constructed around storyworlds within which players inhabit characters and carry out actions via their avatars. Decisions made by the characters lead to the unfolding of the story. Of course, we can tell stories through sports-recounting the tale of the winning goal just seconds before the match ends-or in boardgames-recounting the story of how the players came to almost, but not quite, eliminate the four viruses in Pandemic. But in many videogames, the story is a larger part of the experience. The layered impact of our actions and the advancing of the story often go hand-in-hand. The less directly we control our role in a game, the more story cues help us make sense of what happens and how well we are advancing the story.
  In the game Braid (see Figure 2.25), players control the main character, Tim, who has lost his princess. To help Tim find her, the player navigates Tim through a puzzle platformer game.
- Context of Play The last basic tool of game design is the context within which a game is played. Taking into account where the game is played and by whom has a real impact on the experience. Will players be playing on their phone or tablet? In a public space? Alone or with friends and family? Of course, game designers can't always predict this, but taking it into account can make a big difference for the player. Imagine trying to play a mobile phone game that has hour-long play sessions, and you will soon see why most mobile games have shorter sessions developed around the concept of playing during a commute, in between meetings, or at a coffee shop waiting for a friend to arrive.
  Speaking of mobile games, take the iPhone app, Tiny Games, by Hide and Seek (see Figure 2.28).
  Tiny Games includes just that: a slew of tiny physical games meant to be played in short sessions in a variety of contexts. The first thing the player sees when opening the app is a question: â€œWhere are you?" The player can select Home, Walk, Road, Bar, In Line, or Work. Selecting "Home" and "two players" might get you the game "Knife Fork Spoon," based on the folkgame Rock, Paper, Seissors, to be played while waiting for a piece of bread to pop out of the toaster. Each round, the mer keeps the utensil the other plaver played. By the end of the game (when the toast is done), players have the utensils remaining for their meal, This game is designed to be played with a mend in a kitchen, and as with all of the Tiny Games, is meant for a specific context.
