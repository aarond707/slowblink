## Highlights
- They set up the free breakfast program and the health clinic as examples of what a system responsive to people’s needs would provide and what the current government did not. ([Location 100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07XSGL8YX&location=100))
- The United States is becoming a neo-fascist state where [[White supremacy]] and anti-immigrant hysteria provide the electoral support for a plutocratic agenda. ([Location 102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07XSGL8YX&location=102))
- Unlike the example of a centralized and hierarchical political party like the Panthers, BLM is a decentralized coalition of community groups with a common platform. They say they are “leader full,” not “leader less.” ([Location 182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07XSGL8YX&location=182))

 - “Fred never really woke up,” she said. “He was lying there when they pulled me out of the bedroom.” She paused. “And then?” I asked. “Two pigs went back into the bedroom. One of them said, ‘He’s barely alive, he’ll barely make it.’ I heard two shots. Then I heard, ‘He’s good and dead now!’” Fred’s fiancée looked at me with sad, swollen eyes. “What can you do?” ([Location 361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07XSGL8YX&location=361))
- Atlanta was becoming the government’s showcase for Southern cities because it had not fought integration with the violence of Birmingham, Alabama, or Little Rock, Arkansas.

- I was the first Jew to attend Liberty Gwinn, the county elementary school near our house. My classmates were country white kids, and before they knew I was Jewish, they told me, “Jews have horns.” ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07XSGL8YX&location=450))
- In 1958 our temple (called the Temple) was bombed because our rabbi, Jacob Rothschild, supported Dr. King’s push for integration. Unlike the Frank case, where the Jewish community withdrew for a generation, our congregation rallied behind our rabbi and became more committed to civil rights for blacks.

- Otis Redding, Sam Cooke, Aretha Franklin, B. B. King, and Marvin Gaye made regular appearances at the Peacock. ([Location 484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07XSGL8YX&location=484))
- The band I remember best was Hank Ballard and the Midnighters. Hank wrote the original music and lyrics to “The Twist.” Unfortunately for him, he let Chubby Checker record it, and Hank never quite made it past being a regional hero.
