The book calls itself "a practicioner's guide to designing games." It makes this distinction to set itself apart from other books about game design that are more high-level discussions of design or books that teach programming through game design as a lens or frame.

"By focusing on designing play instead of designing a game, we can choose many different approaches to take us there." (xvi)

The preface lays out the book's approach to teaching game design, and the phases it move through. It starts with early conception and prototyping and ends with launching into production.
The book outlines [[six basic elements of games]]. 

Chapter One fleshes out the basic elements of the game in some detail and ends with some exercises.  I don't know how useful these are since these are concepts I've thought through a lot already.

I'm drawing on this book for [[superstructure]].
