# What currency is in these worlds
##### In Elden Ring, runes are currency.
What are runes that make them valuable? How does a merchant class exist and survive the way that it does through the trade of runes?

#### In Death Stranding, likes are the currency
...except that it sort of doesn't matter? The thing that performs slightly more like currency is raw materials for making things, and this brings up questions I have about how goods and currency flow in [[gameplay worlds]]. 

##### While games typically tell their economic stories as one side making their number go down so that the other side's go up...
...literally being modeled and coded this way - games are not tracking individual things moving from one place to another.

[[death stranding didn't do vacant storefronts]]

[[superstructure will show things moving from person to person]]
