Microscope is a world-building tabletop role-playing game.

I'm using it for generating backstory for [[superstructure]]. 

We're first going to outline our Big Picture, where we brainstorm a simple overview of the history. The examples given in the book for Microscope are
> An ancient empire rises and falls.
> Cavemen at the dawn of time found the first civilization.
> Mankind leaves the sick earth behind and spreads out to the stars.

For [[superstructure]], we're [[worldbuilding in Microscope]]

> Humanity struggles to survive and thrive within the Superstructure
