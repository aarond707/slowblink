>An important pair of tools game designers use to shape play experiences are direct and indirect actions. Direct actions are those in which the player has immediate interaction with objects and the playspace, while indirect actions are those that occur without direct contact by the player or the primary objects they use while playing.
- I like when games narrow the scope of direct actions while maintaining a wide palette of indirect actions. Immersive sims, at their best, do this well.
