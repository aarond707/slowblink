# [[superstructure]] will show things moving from person to person
I want the goods represented in some physical and individual form that can be noticed among a group of people.

If, in [[superstructure]], I can show characters who find things that are important to them - or the player can find these things - then I can generate assets for these objects for NPCs to have, create relationships with, and trade or give or borrow.

The player cannot ask questions about those things, but is able to learn more about those NPCs. There aren't dialog choices. The player can simply talk to an NPC to attempt triggering the next chapter of their monolog. There may be dialog choices, but they are always working in a forward direction. Whether or not the new dialog unlocks depends on whether the player has made certain _other_ dialogs unlock.

A trigger like this could serve a secondary purpose of creating an exchange of gifts in the economic system of the game; from then on, those two characters would move inventory items from one to the other on each cycle of the journey.
