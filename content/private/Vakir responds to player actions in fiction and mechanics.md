The fact that Vakir can lose faith in your leadership and take on the "vexed" status which slows her research is great to me. It's a way in which the game responds with narrative and mechanics to what might otherwise just be mechanical choices. It's an unexpected and person and directly felt mechanical consequence of something you did. It responds with fiction to place your past actions into itself, and then it creates a future context for your gameplay that is also within fiction. Because she is annoyed, she feels unmotivated to work, according to the description. Therefore -50% research speed.
