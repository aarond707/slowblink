The player must move to the next place, the player must talk to and give things to people who ride the mech, and then repeat. The player is a taxi service, but also not. The player is given gifts sometimes, but they are never expected. The player gives freely to anyone who requires anything, and it is not stealing. The player kills things outside the mech that want to kill the passengers. The passengers sometimes are like passengers on a flight who want to wear earbuds, and sometimes they are trying to form governments for and on the in-transit irc app that's more like a glorified intercom. This is a taxi, but it isn't. This is a paid security guard, but not really. This is friendship, but it isn't. It is comradery.
