LucyLavend is a Godot creator and educator who has created some great content, such as [5 Awesome Godot Addons That You Should Give a Try - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_J6G7mi_Q). I also like the vtuber character she uses as an avatar in her videos, specifically how it swaps between keyframes rather than being fully animated. This could be a cool thing to emulate in a game.
